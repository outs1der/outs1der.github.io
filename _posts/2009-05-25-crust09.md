      <a href="http://crust09.blogspot.com/2009/05/at-crust09-x-ray-bursters.html#comments"><img src="images/CRUST09 bursters.JPG" width="100" align="left"></a>I just got back from a terrific meeting in Santa Fe on the subject of the neutron star crust, and attended by a wide range of nuclear theorists and experimentalists as well as astrophysicists. There were many interesting talks, and I learned a lot; one of the overarching themes was the need for better communication between the various groups &mdash; <a href="http://www.physics.mcgill.ca/~rutledge/">Bob Rutledge</a> was remarkably persistent in asking after almost every talk, "what one thing would you like the other groups represented here to take away from your work?" (to paraphrase a little). The meeting was also one of the most "wired" that I have been to, with a <a href="http://crust09.blogspot.com/">blog</a> including twitter updates, and culminating in the creation of a <a href="http://reddit.com">reddit</a> group called <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/neutronstarstructure">neutronstarstructure</a> to collect relevant papers on the subject.<br>
I gave a talk on some of the recent work I've been doing with determining neutron star redshifts and mass, radius from mixed H/He thermonuclear bursts, which prompted quite a response.
