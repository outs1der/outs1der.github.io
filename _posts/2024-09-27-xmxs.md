Had a fantastic time in Leiden this week attending the <a href="https://www.lorentzcenter.nl/extreme-matter-in-extreme-stars-2024.html">Extreme Matter in
Extreme Stars</a>, hosted by the always-brilliant <a href="https://www.lorentzcenter.nl">Lorentz Center</a>. The meeting sought to bring together neutron star
theorists and observers, with nuclear physics theorists and experimenters, as well as people interested in gravitational-wave sources involving neutron stars.
Really nice program with only a few review talks but plenty of opportunity for discussion and short "pop-up" talks, and great attendance by ECRs.
To put our money where our mouths are we were tasked with writing a "white paper" or similar intended to bridge the information/assumption gaps between these
various communities. A week is only enough to really make a start and so our work will continue remotely; stay tuned!</p>
