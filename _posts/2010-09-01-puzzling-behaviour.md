<img src="/images/star_nuclear_exp.jpg" width="100" align="left"> A
bunch of us have been working on the X-ray data from a quite remarkable
transient, IGR&nbsp;J17473-2721, which went into a 6-month long outburst
beginning in 2008. The source went through some dramatic changes in the
burst behaviour, some of which we think we understand, but some of which
we don't. In particular at the beginning and the end of the outburst
completely different burst behaviour is observed at roughly the same
intensity (accretion rate). This effect may be due to the heating of the
neutron star core which has taken place during the outburst. Jerome's
paper is out now on astro-ph at <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1007.5201">arXiv.org:1007.5201</a>.
