As reported by NASA,
<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/topics/universe/features/rxte-complete.html">the
<em>Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer</em> has made its last observation</a>, on January
3<sup>rd</sup> this year. The spacecraft, launched in December 1995, had a
tremendous impact on the study of accreting neutron stars, which has been
celebrated this week with a

<a href="http://aas.org/meetings/aas219">219<sup>th</sup> AAS meeting</a> in
Austin, Texas. <em>RXTE</em> played a 
very personal role for me, having practically made my career; my
PhD thesis was largely based on early observations of a high-magnetic field
accretion-powered pulsar. Since then I've analysed many thousands of hours
of data on millisecond pulsars, thermonuclear burst sources, and other exotica,
and most of my published work has been based on these analyses.
The loss of <em>RXTE</em> means the end to fast X-ray timing for the time
being, at least until the much-anticipated launch of India's
