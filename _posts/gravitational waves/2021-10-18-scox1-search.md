Bright X-ray binaries are thought to be promising candidates for detecting
<em>continuous</em> gravitational waves, because it is possible that the
spin-up torques provided by accretion are offset by gravitational wave 
emission to maintain their equilibrium spin periods. 
A long-standing project led by Monash PhD student 
<a href="https://twitter.com/astronerdika">Shanika Galaudage</a> has sought to use the most sensitive X-ray data available for
the two best candidates, Sco X-1 and Cyg X-2, to make a deep search for 
pulsations that would measure the spin of the compact object in these 
systems.
The analysis was extremely challenging, particularly for Sco X-1; that source
is so bright that highly unusual data modes need to be selected for 
observations with the <em>RXTE</em>/PCA, which complicates the data reduction.
Unfortunately we found no strong evidence of pulsations, but we did derive
the deepest limits on pulse amplitudes ever. The paper describing our results
has now been accepted by MNRAS.
