      <img src="images/gkper.jpg" width="100" height="100" align="left">Aimee's paper on the Fe K&alpha; line profiles from the accretion columns of magnetic CVs was accepted by MNRAS last month. The paper extends Jason Cullen's nonlinear Monte-Carlo code to predict the degree of broadening expected from lines arising from close to the white dwarf. We used a <em>Chandra</em> observation of GK&nbsp;Per in outburst for comparison, and while the relative line strengths in the model is not set by the physical conditions, the results were promising.
