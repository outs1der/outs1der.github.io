      Our paper on the outburst and thermonuclear burst properties of SAX&nbsp;J1808.4-3658 was just accepted by ApJ. We used <em>RXTE</em> observations to constrain the distance, deriving a likely range of 3.4-3.6 kpc. We also compared the burst properties to Andrew C's ignition model to deduce the H-fraction at ignition; these bursts are the first confirmed He-rich bursts which have been studied in detail.<br>
