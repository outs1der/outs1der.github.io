This week I attended the second 
<a href="https://astro.dur.ac.uk/vam2025/binaries">Vasto Accretion Meeting</a>, held in lovely
Vasto, Italy. Building on the success of the 
<a href="/meetings/2023/06/26/june-meeting-month.html">2023 meeting</a>, this year's instalment
was expanded to two weeks duration, with the first week focussing on binaries. The program
covered a wide range of topics and objects, across all wavelengths. A good mix IMO of review
talks and new results, with a strong showing from junior researchers and students.

<p>I gave an invited talk on thermonuclear bursts, which was followed (in the same session) by
terrific presentations by Yuri Cavecchi and Amy Knight. Great discussions followed in the
coffee sessions, held in the beautiful gardens of the lovely
<a href="http://www.museipalazzodavalos.it/wordpress/?page_id=46">Palazzo d'Avalos</a>, with
wonderful views down to the marina and across the Adriatic.

Kudos to the organisers, particularly
<a href="https://www.durham.ac.uk/staff/simone-scaringi">Simone Scaringi</a> for not only
repeating their 2023 success but raising the bar for 2025! 
Looking forward to future instalments of this great meeting!
