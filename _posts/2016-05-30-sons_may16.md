In May I travelled to Athens, OH for the 
<a href="http://www.jinaweb.org">JINA-CEE</a>
<a href="http://www.phy.ohiou.edu/~SoNS/index.html">symposium on neutron
stars</a>.
This was a great week of presentations on a very wide range of astrophysics
topics relating to neutron stars, including my own presentation on 
thermonuclear bursts, but also discussions of new & upcoming missions like
<em><a href="https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/nicer/">NICER</a></em> and
<em><a href="http://astrosat.iucaa.in">ASTROSAT</a></em>,
progress on mass-radius measurements from bursts and cooling
transients, rotation-powered pulsars, gravitational waves, you name it.
The
week kicked off on Sunday with a satellite workshop on 
<a href="https://indico.fnal.gov/internalPage.py?pageId=0&confId=11244">Experiments for X-ray Burst Nucleosynthesis</a>,
where we reviewed the prospects for better experimental constraints on the
many nuclear reactions important to thermonuclear bursts.
A big thank-you to JINA-CEE for supporting my trip!
