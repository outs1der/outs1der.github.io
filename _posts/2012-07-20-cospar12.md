      <img src="images/cospar2012.jpg" width="100" align="left">The
<a href="http://www.cospar2012india.org">39<sup>th</sup> COSPAR Scientific
Assembly</a> was held this week at the remarkable Infosys Global Education 
Centre, Mysore, India.
I gave an invited talk on observations of thermonuclear bursts to session
<a href="http://www.cospar-assembly.org/admin/sessioninfo.php?session=295">E1.3,
<em>Multi-wavelength Studies of Compact Objects with Focus on
ASTROSAT</em></a>. 
<a href="http://www.iucaa.ernet.in/~astrosat/"><em>ASTROSAT</em></a> is
a multi-wavelength astronomy mission under development by the 
<a href="http://www.isro.org/">Indian Space Research Organisation</a>. The 
satellite features a large-area proportional counter (similar to the
<em>RXTE</em>/PCA), as well as two imaging instruments with good low-energy
X-ray sensitivity, an all-sky monitor, and an optical instrument.
The capabilities are well suited to burst studies, and it will be very 
exciting to see what new discoveries will follow the launch  (expected in
2013).
I also gave a talk in session
<a href="http://www.cospar-assembly.org/admin/sessioninfo.php?session=299">E1.7,
<em>Beyond the Continuum: X-ray Line Spectroscopy of Compact Objects</em></a>.
Although a rather difficult trip, it was also productive, and I managed to
catch up with many collaborators and friends,
as well as visiting India for the first time.
