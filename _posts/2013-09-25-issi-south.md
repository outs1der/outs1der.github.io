Our 
<a href="http://www.issibern.ch">International Space Science Institute (ISSI)</a>
team on 
<a href="http://www.issibern.ch/teams/thermo_burst">thermonuclear bursts</a>
called for &mdash; as with all such teams &mdash; two meetings in Bern, 
separated by about a year. For this team, featuring a strong contingent of
members from Monash, we decided to have a mid-term meeting in Melbourne,
sponsored (in part) by the
<a href="http://moca.monash.edu">Monash Centre for Astrophysics (MoCA)</a>.
This inaugural "ISSI-South" meeting, held August 19&mdash;23, featured 9 team
members from Germany, Canada, Netherlands, USA, Denmark and Spain, in addition
to the five local team members and students.

The meeting was as usual a great chance to share recent progress and catch
up with the team's activities. Highlights included the workshop dinner on the
<a href="http://www.tramrestaurant.com.au">Colonial Tramcar Restaurant</a>,
and the windup tag-team seminar to MoCA members by team leader 
<a href="http://www.physics.mcgill.ca/~cumming/">Andrew Cumming</a>
and myself.
