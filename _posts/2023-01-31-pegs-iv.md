The Precision Ephemerides for Gravitational-wave Searches (PEGS) program
has been going now for a decade, with the goal of improving the
sensitivity for <em>continuous</em> gravitational-wave searches. The
neutron star targets for such searches are often in binary systems, so
optimal searches depend on precisely correcting for the orbital motion,
requiring in turn precise orbital parameters (orbital period, semimajor
axis etc.). 
<a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/research/astro">Warwick</a>
student 
<a href="https://tkilleste.in">Tom Killestein</a> has led the latest
instalment of this program, and in his now-accepted 
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00018">paper arXiv:2302.00018</a> has
presented the most precise orbital parameters yet, including
substantial improvements in our understanding of the orbital properties of
Sco X-1. These results are having a 
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10338">direct impact on GW searches</a>,
although sadly no detections as yet. However, Tom's work will continue to
contribute to GW searches into the future, with more observations and
analyses planned.
