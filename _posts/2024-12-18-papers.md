I'm about to go on leave for the holidays, but a couple of papers to note
that just came out, that I had a little involvement with.

Zhi-Qiang You's paper 
"<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05524">The birth mass function of
neutron stars</a>" addresses the problem that many 
of the objects we observe today have had a history of accretion that can
significantly increase their mass, so it's a challenge to work backward
and infer how they started. This initial mass distribution in turn encodes
information about the formative supernova explosions and evolution up to
that point. Zhi-Qiang's paper has now been accepted by Nature Astronomy.

<p>Tao Fu's paper 
"<a href="https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2412.05779">A comprehensive study of
type I (thermonuclear) bursts in the new transient SRGA
J144459.2âˆ’604207</a>" focusses on the remarkable burst behaviour of the
2024-discovered millisecond pulsar, observed with the Chinese
<a href="http://hxmten.ihep.ac.cn"><em>Insight-HXMT</em></a> and NASA's
<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission/imaging-x-ray-polarimetry-explorer-ixpe"><em>IXPE</em></a>
satellites. During a 2-week outburst this source exhibited 60
thermonuclear bursts, with remarkably consistent profiles and recurrence
times. Such "clocked" bursters are key sources for comparison with
numerical models. Tao's paper has now been accepted by ApJ.
