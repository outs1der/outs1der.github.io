      <img src="http://iya09.monash.edu.au/assets/images/iya_logo-small.jpg" width="100" align="left">2009 has been designated the International Year of Astronomy by the <a href="http://iau.org">International Astronomical Union (IAU)</a> and <a href="http://www.unesco.org">UNESCO</a>. I think I can speak for most astronomers when I say that we think astronomy is too much fun to keep to ourselves! There is a lot going on throughout the year, and a group here at Monash have been planning a bunch of fun and interesting activities. Check out the website <a href="http://iya09.monash.edu.au">iya09.monash.edu.au</a> to find out more
