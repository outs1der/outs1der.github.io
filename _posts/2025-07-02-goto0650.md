Our <a href="http://goto-observatory.org">GOTO</a> telescope network has already discovered
many new objects, but GOTO 065054+593624 was a bit special; this 8.5-mag nova outburst was
discovered in real-time, first by our 
<a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/tkillestein/kilonova-seekers">Kilonova Seekers</a>
volunteers. Team members 
<a href="https://tkilleste.in">Tom Killestein</a> 
and
<a href="https://www.kicc.cam.ac.uk/staff/dr-lisa-kelsey">Lisa Kelsey</a> report the discovery
in their <a
href="https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2025/07/aa53823-25/aa53823-25.html">paper</a>,
now accepted by Astronomy & Astrophysics.

As reported in the paper, the followup observations provided extensive coverage of the
"superoutburst", which exhibited typically complex behaviour for such objects; an initially
declining bright phase lasting approx. 3 weeks, followed by 10(!) successive "re-flares" each
lasting just a few days. Remarkably, this object may have been detected in outburst last in
1951, 73 years ago!
