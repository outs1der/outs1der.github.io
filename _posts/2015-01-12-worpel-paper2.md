In a study of several hundred "photospheric radius-expansion" bursts observed by the 
<a href="http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/xte/"><em>Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer</a></em>, Monash PhD student
<a href="http://users.monash.edu.au/~hworpel">Hauke Worpel</a> 
found evidence that the accretion rate increases by a substantial amount during
the burst (see the 
<a href="/~dgallow/cgi-bin/blosxom.cgi/thermonuclear%20bursts/accretion-rate.html">previous post</a>).
As a followup, Hauke also analysed the much larger sample of almost 1800 less-intense
bursts, that did not exhibit radius expansion. The additional analyses confirm
the original result, and further support the interpretation that the 
accretion rate is increasing in response to the bursts. Interestingly, even 
including the amplified contribution from the persistent (accretion) emission
does not result in a formally good fit to all the spectra, suggesting that
the burst spectrum deviates significantly from a blackbody.
Hauke's paper was just accepted by ApJ.
