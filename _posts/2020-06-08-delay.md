SAX&nbsp;J1808.4&mdash;3658 is the first accretion-powered millisecond pulsar
ever discovered, and still one of the best-studied, thanks to a quasi-regular
series of outbursts since 1996.
Based on the regularity of the outbursts, I'd predicted that it would return
to activity in 2019 May. This prediction was a <em>bit</em> off, as it turned
out, since we didn't hear a peep out of it until late July in the same year. 
Even so, thanks to the prediction and a series of optical and X-ray
observations led by Monash PhD student Adelle Goodwin, we gathered data giving
a view of the outburst onset of unprecedented detail. </p>
<p>Adelle presented her work at the 
<a href="https://aasnova.org/2020/06/02/aas-236-day-1">236<sup>th</sup> AAS meeting</a>
last week, and also took part in a press event the same day. Our
<a href="https://www.monash.edu/science/news/current/astronomers-capture-a-pulsar-powering-up">press release</a> got picked up and distributed widely, at

Adelle also appeared on 
<a href="https://www.rrr.org.au/explore/programs/einstein-a-go-go">RRR's Einstein-a-go-go</a> show and was interviewed by a number of other outlets. 
</p>
<p>
On the science side, the unexpectedly long delay of 12d between the optical and
X-ray activity may have implications for the most widely-accepted model which
explains how these outbursts are triggered. Adelle's paper on the study has
been submitted to <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras">MNRAS</a>.
</p>
<p>And the next outburst? You'll 
have to wait until 2023 November &mdash; or perhaps even later.
