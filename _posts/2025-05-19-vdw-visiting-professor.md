I am honoured and grateful to take up the role of
<a href="https://api.uva.nl/content/news/2025/05/duncan-galloway-appointed-as-van-der-waals-visiting-professor.html">van
der Waals Visiting Professor</a> at the 
<a href="https://api.uva.nl">Anton Pannekoek Institute for Astronomy</a>,
UvA this May. The visit is a fantastic opportunity to work with
long-standing collaborators as well as making new connections both in API
and the Gravitation and AstroParticle Physics Amsterdam (GRAPPA) group.
</p>
<p>Research plans include working on thermonuclear bursts, to combine
modelling efforts on the burst energetics and oscillations, with a view to
constraining the properties of the neutron-star hosts. Additionally, I
hope to engage with those interested in multi-wavelength followups of
gravitational-wave events, along similar lines to our 
<a href="http://goto-observatory.org">GOTO</a> project. </p>
<p>Very excited to kick off the visit shortly!</p>
