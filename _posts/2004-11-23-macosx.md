      Some notes relevant to astro-types thinking about migrating from other *nix platforms to <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/overview/">OS X</a>. People keep asking me about it.
<p>
The biggest advantage is avoiding dual-boot arrangements and and messing around with
partitions etc., but still having access to commercial packages such as 
<a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/applications/office/">Microsoft Office</a> (as well as <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">iTunes</a> of course!)
<br>
Astronomical data analysis packages that have been ported to OS X (not by any means complete):
<ul>
<li><a href="http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/lheasoft/">HEAsoft</a> comprising the FTools and XANADU packages for X-ray data analysis (<em>RXTE</em>, <em>ASCA</em> etc.)
<li><a href="http://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/">CIAO</a> for <em>Chandra</em> data analysis
<li><a href="http://xmm.vilspa.esa.es/sas/">SAS</a> v6.1.0 for <em>XMM-Newton</em> data analysis
<li><a href="http://iraf.noao.edu/">IRAF</a>, a general purpose system for the reduction and analysis of astronomical data (see the dedicated <a href="http://www.owlnet.rice.edu/~marcosh/iraf/">maciraf</a> page)
<li><a href="http://www.atnf.csiro.au/computing/software/karma/">Karma</a>, a "toolkit for interprocess communications, authentication, encryption, graphics display, user interface and manipulating the Karma network data structure".
</ul>
Packages that have NOT as yet been ported (completely)
<ul>
<li><a href="http://bima.astro.umd.edu/miriad/">MIRIAD</a>
</ul>
Other essential packages:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net">Fink</a> for GNU tool ports (including <a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/pdb/package.php/xv">xv</a>, the <a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/pdb/package.php/gimp">Gimp</a>, <a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/pdb/package.php/tetex">tetex</a> etc.)
<li><a href="http://xonx.sourceforge.net">XonX</a>, XFree86 on OS X (forget the <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/x11/">Apple
version</a>)
<li><a href="http://oroborosx.sourceforge.net">OroborOSX</a>  allows you to interleave
Aqua (OS X) and X windows
<li><a href="http://codetek.com/ctvd">CodeTek Virtual Desktop</a> offers a trial version (although this is a bit redundant now that <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/expose/">Expos&eacute;</a> is a part of OS X)
</ul>
As for security, by default, OS X won't allow any
connections from outside, unless you explicitly allow them. There is
built-in firewall, and encryption of folder
contents (<a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/filevault/">FileVault</a>) if you want either of those. As well there aren't all the nasty
viruses and crap for Mac at the moment that there are for Windows
(although that may change in the future if Apple significantly increases
market share!)
