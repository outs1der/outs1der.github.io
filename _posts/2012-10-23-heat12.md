The high-energy (and gravitational wave) astrophysics community in Australia
has always been a bit under the radar, with a relatively small number of
internationally recognised (but widely-dispersed) researchers. From
2006&mdash;9 I scheduled regular teleconferences to bring together researchers
in the field, which provided a great way for this community to interact and
share information.  With the loss of a few key participants in 2009, these
telecons ceased.  However, with the influx of new researchers to astrophysics
over the last few years, thanks to the <a
href="http://www.arc.gov.au/ncgp/ssf/ssf_default.htm">Super Science fellowship
scheme</a> and other initiatives, the number of researchers with some interest
in this field is larger than perhaps any time before. As a result, I'm happy to announce the first High-Energy Astrophysics Telecon (or HEAT) for 2012. Curtin's James Miller-Jones will report on recently-discovered evidence for intermediate-mass black holes in M22.</p>
