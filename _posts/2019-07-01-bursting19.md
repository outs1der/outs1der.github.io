In June I attended  the <a href="http://lorentzcenter.nl">Lorentz Center</a> workshop
<a href="https://www.lorentzcenter.nl/lc/web/2019/1174/info.php3?wsid=1174&venue=Snellius">Bursting the Bubble: Connecting Thermonuclear Burst Research to a Wider Community</a> in Leiden, NL.
This meeting is the continuation of a series of meetings on the same topic, 
most recently with the <a href="http://burst.sci.monash.edu/bern18">BERN'18</a>
meeting, but originally
a series of <a href="http://www.issibern.ch">ISSI</a> international teams
since about 2010.
This year's meeting featured a selected group of attendees with the goal of
bringing our burst research to a wider community, most notably those observers interested in novae, the WD analogues of thermonuclear bursts.
A highlight for me was <a href="https://billwolf.space">Bill Wolf</a>'s tutorial
session on simulating bursts and novae with <a href="http://mesa.sourceforge.net">MESA</a>.
The centre
proved terrific facilities and support for the great presentations and
discussions we had over the week. As with previous meetings,
<a href="https://www.jinaweb.org">JINA-CEE</a> was a generous sponsor of the
event, with support specifically aimed at enabling attendance by early-career
scientists.
Thanks also go to the dedicated team of organisers led by the irrepressible
<a href="https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/a.l.watts">Anna Watts</a>!
