The third accreting millisecond pulsar discovered in 2011 August by 
ESA's <a href="http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/area/index.cfm?fareaid=21"><em>INTEGRAL</em></a> satellite,
IGR&nbsp;J17498-2921 was found by <em>RXTE</em> to pulse at 401&nbsp;Hz.
Although this might seem fast (401 times every second!), it is nowhere near
the record for a millsecond X-ray pulsar (599&nbsp;Hz, for IGR&nbsp;J00291+5934)
or even for a radio pulsar (716&nbsp;Hz, for 
<a href="">PSR&nbsp;J1748-2446ad</a>)
Subsequent observations revealed Doppler modulations of the pulse indicating
a 3.8&nbsp;hr orbit, as well as thermonuclear burst activity.
<a href="http://www.issibern.ch">ISSI</a>'s 
<a href="http://www.issibern.ch/aboutissi/members/falanga.html">Maurizio
Falanga</a> led a paper on the properties of the source and its behaviour
throughout the outburst. The paper has just been accepted by A&A.
