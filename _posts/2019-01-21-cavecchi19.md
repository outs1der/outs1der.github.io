<a href="https://www.southampton.ac.uk/maths/about/staff/yc3e16.page">Yuri
Cavecchi</a> visited Monash this month, supported by the
<a href="http://moca.monash.edu">MoCA</a> Distinguished Visitor Program.
Yuri and I have been working for a few years now on the global properties of
thermonuclear bursts, particuarly the ignition conditions and how they
respond to changes in accretion rate, motivated by 
<a href="http://users.monash.edu.au/~dgallow/cgi-bin/blosxom.cgi/thermonuclear%20bursts/burst_rates.html">observations with MINBAR</a>.
Yuri had already come up with a 
<a href="http://users.monash.edu/~dgallow/cgi-bin/blosxom.cgi/thermonuclear%20bursts/burst-rates-theory.html">possible explanation</a> for the drop in burst
rates that is observed as accretion rates increase in some sources; during
the visit we plan to work on matching the models in more detail to the observations. Stay tuned for exciting results coming soon!
