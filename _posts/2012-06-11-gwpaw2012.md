Last week I visited Hannover for the 
<a href="https://gwpaw2012.aei.mpg.de/">Gravitational Wave Physics and Astronomy</a>
workshop, hosted by <a href="http://www.aei-hannover.de/">AEI-Hannover</a>.  I
first attended this series of meetings, previously GWDAW, back in 2011; the
attendees are a very interesting confluence of astrophysicists and
gravitational-wave experimentalists.
I presented the recent work with <a href="http://physics.monash.edu.au/people/students/premachandra.html">Shakya Premachandra</a> on the orbital period of
Sco X-1. I was also called in at the last minute to give a talk on the 
status and capabilities of the 
<a href="http://www.atnf.csiro.au/projects/askap/">Australian Square Kilometre
Array Pathfinder</a> and the 
<a href="http://www.mwatelescope.org/">Mileura Widefield Array</a>, replacing
David Kaplan, who had to leave. The prospects for radio followup of future
detections of graviational waves with advanced interferometers are very
exciting!
We also had the chance to visit the 
<a href="http://www.geo600.org/">GEO600</a> interferometric gravitational
wave detector, just outside Hannover, which was great (although rainy).
