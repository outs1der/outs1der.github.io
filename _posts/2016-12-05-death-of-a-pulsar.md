The 599&nbsp;Hz millisecond pulsar IGR&nbsp;J00291+5934 is a source I've been 
studying for more than a decade, having been involved in the 
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2005ApJ...622L..45G">discovery</a> as well as observation of every transient outburst since.
Although the first few outbursts displayed a remarkable predictability,
the most recent, in 2015, was almost 3 years "late". In a detailed study of 
the <a href="http://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/integral"><em>INTEGRAL</em></a>
and <a href="http://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov"><em>Swift</em></a>
observations of the outburst, 
<a href="">ISSI</a> PhD student
<a href="http://www.issibern.ch/aboutissi/members/defalco.html">Vittorio De Falco</a> 
examined the broad-band X-ray spectrum and the pulse properties, as well
as data covering the first thermonuclear burst ever detected from the source.
Remarkably, the estimated time-averaged accretion rate is decreasing on a
timescale of only a few years, suggesting that we are unlikely to see another
bright outburst in the next decade, if ever. Vittorio's paper was just 
accepted by A&A.
