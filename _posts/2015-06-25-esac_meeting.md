This June the terrific people at ESAC hosted a 3-day
<a href="http://www.sciops.esa.int/index.php?project=CONF2015&page=XRAYBURST2015">workshop</a>
to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the discovery of X-ray bursts.
The workshop featured a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art of
burst physics and phenomenology, and plenty of opportunities for productive
discussions. The organisers included a conference dinner at the fantastic
<a href="http://www.restaurante-vasco-zerain-sidreria.es/pages">Rstaurante Zerain</a>
which was a terrific (if very late) night out.
It was also wonderful to spend some time in Madrid, and enjoy some sunshine!
On behalf of my SOC <a href="http://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/personal-profiles/erik-kuulkers">co-chair</a>,
I had a lot of fun presenting the conference summary.
