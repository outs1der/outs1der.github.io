This June I visited Niigata, Japan for the 
<a href="http://nic2016.jp">14th Nuclei in the Cosmos</a> meeting. This
biennial gathering attracts a mix of nuclear experimentalists, modelers,
and astrophysicists. I presented a poster on our thermonuclear burst
model-observation comparisons.<br>
Following the meeting I stopped by
<a href="http://www.riken.jp/en">RIKEN</a> in Tokyo, where members of the 
<a href="http://maxi.riken.jp">MAXI</a> instrument team were the very 
generous hosts of a meeting of our 
<a href="http://www.issibern.ch">International Space Science Institute</a>
<a href="http://www.issibern.ch/teams/labtostars/index.php/team/">international team</a>.
The Monitor of All-Sky X-ray Image (MAXI) instrument, deployed on NASA's
<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main">International Space Station</a>,
has been continuously monitoring the X-ray sky for several years, and has
detected many rare, long-duration thermonuclear bursts, as well as transient
outbursts of known and new sources.
