After significant delays throughout the second half of 2022, the concrete
slab for the new GOTO-South site at 
<a href="https://www.sidingspring.com.au">Siding Spring Observatory</a>
near Coonabarabran, NSW was finally complete in mid-November. Our 
<a href="https://astrohaven.com">AstroHaven</a> domes had been there (in
bits) for some time, so 
<a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/research/astro/people/paulchote/">Paul
Chote</a> made the long trek from the UK to join me there in the first
week of December, and lead their assembly.
</p>
<p>We were a bit shorthanded as other Warwick personnel were unable to travel
due to visa delays, but we were well supported by the 
<a href="https://rsaa.anu.edu.au">RSAA</a> on-site staff who also provided
the necessary lifting gear and tools. After a fairly gruelling 6 days of
hard work the domes were complete and fully functional!
</p>
<p>The next step will be to run power and internet, and then (hopefully in
late Feb or early March 2023) to install the telescopes themselves. All on
track for operations to coincide with the next

run</a>!
