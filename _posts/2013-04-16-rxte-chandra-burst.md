Back in November 2011, the 401-Hz millisecond pulsar SAX&nbsp;J1808.4-3658
went into another of it's regular (every ~3 yr) outbursts. 
SRON's <a href="http://www.sron.nl/~jeanz">Jean in 't Zand</a> had a 
target-of-opportunity 
<em><a href="http://chandra.harvard.edu">Chandra</a></em> program targeting bright PRE bursts
of another source,
and managed to convince the TAC to observe SAX&nbsp;J1808.4-3658 instead.
</p>
<p>
We only detected one burst in the <em>Chandra</em> observation, but it
was a beauty &mdash; perhaps the brightest ever seen from the source, and
it was observed simultaneously by 
<em><a href="http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/xte/xtegof.html">RXTE</a></em>! Although we found no 
evidence for discrete spectral features in the burst (the goal of the 
<em>Chandra</em> observation), the simultaneous observation gave us a unique
view on the broad-band X-ray spectrum during the burst. Remarkably, we found
evidence that the persistent flux level varies during the burst, increasing
by a factor of up to 20 while the burst is active.

This result echoes the findings of my student 
<a href="http://users.monash.edu.au/~hworpel">Hauke Worpel</a>, who found
the same effect in a much wider study of several hundred such bursts observed
with <em>RXTE</em> (see
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.4824">arxiv:1303.4824</a>).
Jean's paper was just accepted by A&A.
