The legacy of NASA's <a href="https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/xte/xte_1st.html"><em>Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer</a></em> continues to grow with the discovery of another burst oscillation in archival data from bursts observed more than 10 years ago, from the faint transient SAX&nbsp;J1810.8--2609.
These burst oscillations, revealed by the careful work of 
<a href="http://www.uva.nl/en/profile/b/i/g.bilous/g.bilous.html">Anya Bilous</a>, confirm the spin frequency of the neutron star in this system at 532 Hz (that's an amazing 532 rotations <em>every second!</em>).
This discovery adds to only a few tens of such measurements amongst the more than 100 known <a href="http://burst.sci.monash.edu/sources">bursting sources</a>. Anya's paper is now accepted by ApJ.
