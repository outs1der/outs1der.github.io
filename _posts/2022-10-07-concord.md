Observations of thermonuclear bursts offer opportunities to learn about
the <a
href="https://theconversation.com/explainer-what-is-a-neutron-star-29341">neutron
stars</a> where they occur, but there are often important astrophysical
factors that can systematically affect the inference process. Based on our
experience with analysing X-ray data for the <a
href="https://burst.sci.monash.edu/minbar">MINBAR</a> and other projects,
we have assembled a suite of routines to try to take some of the hard work
out of burst analysis.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/outs1der/concord">concord</a> set of
tools take the fundamental burst measurements and allow the user to infer
(for example) the fuel composition, which in turn constrains the
evolutionary state of the mass donor, all while including uncertainties
such as the anisotropy of emission introduced by the system geometry. A
major motivation of the project is the ability to incorporate
model-observation comparisons into wider analysis involving other types of
data.</p>
<p>The paper has been published in <a
href="https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4365/ac98c9">ApJS</a> and the code is
available at Github along with extensive documentation and examples.
