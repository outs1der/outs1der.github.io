      <img src="images/Jimmy Neutron Star.jpg" width="100" align="left">Shakya Premachandra's paper on the orbital ephemeris
of Cyg X-2, the next-best candidate LMXB (after 
<a
href="http://users.monash.edu.au/~dgallow/cgi-bin/blosxom.cgi/gravitational%20waves/comparison.html">Sco X-1</a>) for continuous
gravitational waves, has now been accepted by ApJ.
Systems like Cyg X-2 and Sco X-1 may produce detectable gravitational radiation
from "mountains" on the rapidly rotating neutron star, and precise knowledge of
the system parameters (including the orbital period and neutron star spin
frequency) may be critical for optimal GW searches 
with <a href="http://www.ligo.caltech.edu">LIGO</a>. However, many of
the candidates are rather poorly known, so Shakya's analysis assembled the
available data on the source to improve this situation. 
The accepted paper is available now at 
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.03233">arXiv:1604.03233</a>.
