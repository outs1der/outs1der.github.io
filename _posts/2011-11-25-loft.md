Last month I had a flying visit to Amsterdam to attend the 
<a href="http://www.isdc.unige.ch/loft/index.php/meetings/loft-science-meeting">first science
meeting</a> dedicated to ESA's proposed 
<a href="http://www.isdc.unige.ch/loft">Large Observatory for X-ray Timing
(LOFT)</a> mission.
This concept has been chosen for the assessment phase of ESA's M3 "Cosmic
Vision" call, and will compete with three other missions for a launch from
2020 onwards. With effective area approximately 20x that of the previous
timing mission, NASA's 
<a href="http://heasarc.nasa.gov/docs/xte/xtegof.html"><em>RXTE</a></em>,
LOFT would provide stunning new observations of rapidly rotating neutron stars
and black holes, sufficient to precisely measure neutron-star mass and radii,
and also probe the spacetime close to black holes. The mission assessment
is being led by researchers at 
<a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/mssl">MSSL</a> (UK) and 
<a href="http://www.space.dtu.dk/English.aspx">DTU Space</a> (Denmark).
I'll be contributing to the general science working group, as well as
the group focussed on dense matter.
