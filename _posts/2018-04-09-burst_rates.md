<p>Many burst sources exhibit inexplicable decreases in burst rate even as the 
accretion rate increases. However, not all burst sources show the same type
of behaviour, which hasn't been understood to date. Using the 
<a href="http://burst.sci.monash.edu/minbar">MINBAR</a> sample,
we measured the burst rate as a function of
accretion rate, from seven neutron stars with known spin rates.
At the highest accretion rates, the
burst rate is lower for faster spinning stars. The observations imply that fast
(> 400 Hz) rotation encourages stabilization of nuclear burning, suggesting a
dynamical dependence of nuclear ignition on the spin rate. This dependence is
unexpected, because faster rotation entails less shear between the surrounding
accretion disk and the star. Although we don't yet fully understand this 
behaviour, it's hoped that further analysis and simulations will help to
explain it. Our paper has now been accepted by ApJL.
