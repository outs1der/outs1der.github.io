      Greetings from the <a href="http://www.aas.org/meetings/aas206/">206<sup>th</sup> AAS meeting</a>, all this week in Minneapolis. I presented a talk in <a href="http://www.aas.org/publications/baas/v37n2/aas206/S170.htm">Special Session 17: Fundamental Physics with Millisecond Pulsars</a> about the newest accretion-powered millisecond pulsar, IGR&nbsp;J00291+5934<br clear="left">
<a href="/~dgallow/docs/Galloway_17_06.pdf"><em>Link to PDF file</em></a><br>
<img src="images/prediction.gif" align="left">I also mentioned the outburst history to date of SAX&nbsp;J1808.4-3658, and commented that we were overdue for the next one; two days later a <a href="http://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=505">new outburst</a> was detected in the PCA bulge scans.
