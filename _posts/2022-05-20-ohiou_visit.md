My first overseas work trip in more than 2 years started off with a visit
to <a href="https://www.ohio.edu">Ohio U.</a> to try to pick up some
neglected collaborative projects with <a
href="https://www.ohio.edu/cas/meisel">Zach Meisel</a>. We made a bit of
progress in running new models of thermonuclear bursts for comparison with
key burst sources, as well as looking at comparisons between different
model codes and other key steps. I also enjoyed a tour of the <a
href="https://inpp.ohio.edu/~oual">Edwards Accelerator Lab</a> and learned
that their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelletron">Pelletron</a>
is of an unusual design, matched only by a twin in Athens, Greece.

river</a> around the campus, which was completed in 1971.
Athens is a nice
town and offers some great <a

Hockhocking Adena Bikeway up to Nelsonville.
