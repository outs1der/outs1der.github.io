Sco X-1 is the brightest X-ray source (excluding the sun) in the sky, and 
is potentially also the brightest source of continuous gravitational waves.
<a href="http://www.physics.gla.ac.uk/igr/index.php?L1=members&L2=member&name=cmessenger">Chris Messenger</a>
led a multi-year project aimed at determining the relative benefits of
a number of search algorithms that will likely be applied to 
<a href="https://www.advancedligo.mit.edu">aLIGO</a> data. The mock-data
challenge provided simulated data including signals at a range of strains,
and each algorithm then attempted to find the signals. Encouragingly, the
faintest detected signal is only a factor of two stronger than the estimated
torque balance limit, which indicates that this limit may be beaten with
improved algorithms, data, and also perhaps system parameter precision.</p>
