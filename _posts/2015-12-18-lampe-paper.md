Monash researcher
<a href="http://2sn.org">Alexander Heger</a> has been for many years exploring
the dependence of thermonuclear burst properties on the source conditions,
including accretion rate and fuel composition. A year or two back Honours
student 
<a href="http://www.natlampe.com">Nathanael Lampe</a> took all of the models
Alexander had compiled over the years, and performed a common analysis, 
measuring the burst recurrence time and energetics, for the purposes of
comparing broadly to observations, as well as understanding the stability
properties of the bursts. As part of this analysis, Nathanael assembled a
table giving the properties of bursts in each available run. Nathanal's paper
has now been accepted by ApJ, and it is anticipated that the 
<a href="http://burst.sci.monash.edu/kepler/pmwiki.php?n=Kepler.Kepler">burst table</a>
will become a useful resource for observers (and theorists) in years 
to come.
