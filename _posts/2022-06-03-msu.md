After a trip to the excellent <a href="https://www.airzoo.org">Air Zoo</a>
on the way I visited colleagues at <a href="https://msu.edu">MSU</a> in
East Lansing. With <a href="https://web.pa.msu.edu/people/ebrown">Ed
Brown</a> and students I'm working more on combining constraints derived
from thermonuclear burst observations & modelling, with other information,
including the history of cooling following transient outbursts.</p>
<p>
I also got to catch up with Monash alum <a
href="https://astro.natsci.msu.edu/people/zac-johnston">Zac Johnston</a>,
now a postdoc there. <a href="https://people.nscl.msu.edu/~schatz">Hendrik
Schatz</a> kindly took us on a tour of (the publicly-accessible bits of)
the newly-operational <a href="https://frib.msu.edu">Facility for Rare
Isotope Beams</a>
