It's an exciting time for Indian science at the moment, with the 
<a href="http://www.isro.gov.in/update/28-sep-2015/pslv-successfully-launches-india's-multi-wavelength-space-observatory-astrosat">September 28<sup>th</sup> launch</a> of the 
<a href="http://astrosat.iucaa.in">ASTROSAT</a> multiwavelength astronomy mission, 
and the development of a new interferometric gravitational-wave detector, 
<a href="http://www.gw-indigo.org">IndIGO</a>.
Motivated by these developments, the 
<a href="https://www.icts.res.in">International Centre for Theoretical Sciences</a>
hosted a <a href="http://www.icts.res.in/discussion_meeting/gwa2015">joint worshop</a> between November 4<sup>th</sup>&mdash;6<sup>th</sup> with the Albert Einstein Institute, at the new ICTS campus north of Bengaluru (Bangalore). 
The meeting featured a range of talks on searches for gravitational waves as
well as X-ray, radio and optical followup. I gave an invited talk on our 
knowledge of the orbital parameters of the best continuous-wave candidate source, <a href="http://chandra.harvard.edu/xray_sources/sco/sco.html">Scorpius X-1</a>, based on our <a href="http://users.monash.edu.au/~dgallow/cgi-bin/blosxom.cgi/gravitational%20waves/comparison.html">2014 paper</a>.
