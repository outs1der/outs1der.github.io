Cavecchi</a> has done more than anyone IMO to understand the broad properties of thermonuclear
bursts. In his latest paper (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11966">arXiv:2506.11966</a>)
he describes further refinement of his
<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.499.2148C">phenomenological model</a> that
explains the relative inefficiency of unstable thermonuclear burning at high accretion
rates.</p>
<p>The model has several requirements, including a varying distribution of accretion over
the neutron star; stable burning (at the equator) coexisting with unstable (at higher
latitudes); and significant "pollution" of the burst fuel by ashes dredged up into the fuel
layer, possibly by convection. This pollution contribution is now on a firmer basis with
support from <a href="https://docs.mesastar.org">MESA</a> simulations, and as a whole the model
matches the burst observations and potentially allows us to deduce changes in the accretion
disk geometry close to the star. The paper is under review by ApJL.</p>
