PhD student <a href="https://twitter.com/astro_del">Adelle Goodwin</a> has
been working hard trying to reconcile results of our 1-D time-dependent 
thermonuclear burst code
<a href="https://burst.sci.monash.edu/kepler">Kepler</a> with those of a 
much simpler (and much faster) code while trying to model the bursts from
a millisecond pulsar, SAX&nbsp;1808.4&mdash;3658. Continuing failure of this
effort led to suspicion about the formula for the nuclear energy yield, and
some careful experiments with Kepler revealed that the widely-used
approximation for the energy generation adopted for the simpler code
substantially overestimated the
contribution lost as neutrinos. Adelle's paper on the study has now been
published by ApJ. Adelle's work was also highlighted in the 2018 December
edition of the <a href="https://www.jinaweb.org/sites/default/files/2018-12/JINA-CEE-Newsletter-December-2018.pdf">JINA-CEE Newsletter</a>.
