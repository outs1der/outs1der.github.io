Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are remarkable cosmological events, broadcasting
their violent origins out across the universe. These events are also a
high-priority target for our 
<a href="http://goto-observatory.org">GOTO</a> network of telescopes,
which is particularly well suited to following up the (rather
poorly-localised) event from NASA's
<a href="https://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov"><em>Fermi</em></a> space telescope.
Observations of the optical, X-ray and radio afterglows of these events
can provide important information to understand their origin and
energetics.

<p>One such event discovered recently is notable for it's feebleness (in a
relative sense!) Leicester's 
<a href="https://twitter.com/MitiPatel15">Miti Patel</a> made a study of
the extensive multi-wavelength data obtained in the followup of
GRB&nbsp;201015A, which is unusually soft and weak for such events. Miti's
<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.523.4923P">paper
(now published in MNRAS)</a> suggests that off-axis viewing, shock
breakout into a denser envelope, or an intrinsically less energetic jet
might explain such weak events. While such weak events are rare in part
due to the difficulty of detecting them with current instruments, future
missions including
<a href="https://www.svom.eu/en/the-svom-mission">SVOM</a> and the
soon-to-be-launched 
<a href="https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/einstein-probe">Einstein Probe</a>
can be expected to detect proportionately more examples thanks to their
sensitivity and bandwidth.</p>
