IGR J00291+5934, as well as being the fastest known accretion-powered
millisecond pulsar, is unusual in that it's shown repeated outbursts that 
have been observed by <em>RXTE</em>. Jake Hartman, Deepto and I had been 
close to submitting a terrific paper doing the phase connection between the
2004 and 2008 outbursts, when to our dismay Alessandro Patruno posted a paper
(<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.0815">arXiv:1006.0815</a>)
with the same timing analysis. Now in a rush to get ours out, three days later
came a separate analysis from Papitto et al.
(<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.1303">arXiv:1006.1303</a>). Finally, two
days later, ours was submitted, to the Astrophysical Journal, and to 
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.1908">arXiv:1006.1908</a>. Of course, I 
think ours is best, not least because Jake did a really nice analysis which
interprets the shape of the unusual double 2008 outburst in terms of the
disk ionisation structure. Now it is a 
race to see who will get published first!
