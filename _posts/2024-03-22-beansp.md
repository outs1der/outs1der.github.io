Almost 20 years ago I made the first attempt to match thermonuclear bursts
with the predictions of Andrew Cumming's "settle" code, for the well-known
accretion-powered millisecond pulsar SAX&nbsp;1808.4&mdash;3658. The code
was written in IDL and kind of clunky, but worked (after a fashion).</p>
<p><a href="https://adellej.github.io">Adelle Goodwin</a> took up the
reins for her undergrad, and later PhD work, updating both the settle code
and translating my crusty IDL code into Python. Over that time we 
(with <a href="https://github.com/TomHilder">Tom Hilder</a> and
others) also attempted to apply the code to additional sources, but could
never quite get it to work.</p>
<p>With the expert help of the <a href="https://adacs.org.au">ADACS</a>
team, via a project led by Adelle, we have made substantial corrections
and improvements to the matching code, now known as 
<a href="https://github.com/adellej/beans">beansp</a> (the "p" is silent).
In a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16471">new paper</a> submitted to
MNRAS, we have now successfully applied the code to a second system,
IGR&mdash;J17498&mdash;2921. This (also) 401 Hz pulsar went into outburst
in 2011 and exhibited a series of bursts, which we matched with settle to
infer a very low H-fraction and metallicity. We also constrain the system
inclination and find suggestions for a massive (around twice the mass of
our sun) neutron star.</p>
<p>Hopefully the code will be applied to additional systems in the near
future!</p>
