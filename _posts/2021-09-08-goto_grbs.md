Our <a href="http://goto-observatory.org">GOTO</a> prototype, while optimised
for gravitational-wave followups, is also well suited to detecting optical
counterparts of gamma-ray bursts detected by 
<a href="https://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov"><em>Fermi</em></a>. Monash PhD candidate
Yik Lun (Travis) Mong recently completed his analysis of our followup of 93
such events, focusing on 53 with favourable observational conditions. 
Unfortunately we couldn't confirm any counterparts (although he did find some
intriguing candidates!)</p>
<p>Perhaps more importantly, Travis' analysis offers some lessons for future 
followup campaigns to help improve our chances of success. Travis' paper,
in collaboration with the GOTO team, has been accepted by MNRAS
