      <img src="/images/asa_usyd12.jpg" width="100" align="left">The
<a href="http://asa.astronomy.org.au/asa.html">Astronomical Society of
Australia</a> held its <a
href="http://www.asa2012.phys.unsw.edu.au">Annual Scientific Meeting</a> at 
<a href="http://www.unsw.edu.au/">UNSW</a>'s Kensington Campus in Sydney this
week.
It is always a good chance to catch up with old friends and colleagues, and
this instalment was no exception. 
I was particularly pleased to see a strong showing from MoCA, including
students Hauke Worpel, Sammanani (Shakya) Premachandra, and Nathanael Lampe,
who all presented posters.
Perhaps it is unreasonable of me to complain about having to compete with
the <a href="https://cdsweb.cern.ch/record/1459604">announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson</a> which occurred during my talk &mdash; at least
it should never happen again!
