      <img src="/images/midyear_phone_2004.ppt.jpg" width="100" align="left">We just had the first <a href="http://users.monash.edu.au/~dgallow/heat">High-Energy Astrophysics Teleconference (HEAT)</a> this afternoon, hosted by yours truly. The idea is to bring observers and theorists interested in high-energy astrophysics together on a regular basis, to share information, present new results, and generally build our small, diverse, and highly dispersed community. We had a round of introductions followed by a little science discussion, and suggestions for future topics and presentations; everthing went very well. The next meeting is scheduled for Friday October 13th at noon &mdash; please <a href="mailto:Duncan.Galloway@sci.monash.edu.au">email me</a> if you are interested in taking part.
