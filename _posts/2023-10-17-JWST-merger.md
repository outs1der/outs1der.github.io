GRB 230307A was an exceptionally bright long-duration gamma-ray burst
first detected by the <a href="https://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov"><em>Fermi</em></a>
Gamma-ray Burst Monitor on 7 March.  Such events are usually understood to
arise from the supernova of a massive star; unexpectedly, optical followup
indicated behaviour similar to a kilonova, until now associated with
<em>short-duration</em> bursts (which are thought to arise instead from
compact object mergers, like the famous
<a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GW170817">GW170817</a>). </p>
<p><a href="https://www.ru.nl/en/people/levan-a">Andrew Levan</a> and
collaborators carried out extensive optical imaging and spectroscopy
following the event, which I played an infinitessimally small role in.
Most excitingly, the campaign also found a spectral line feature in JWST
mid-IR spectrum, possibly arising from Tellurium produced (presumably
along with other heavy elements) during the event. The 
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06759-1">paper</a> has
now been accepted by Nature and is also available at 
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02098">arXiv:2307.02098</a>.</p>
