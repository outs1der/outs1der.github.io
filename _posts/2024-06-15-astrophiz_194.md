Brendan O'Brien runs the amazing 
<a href="https://astrophiz.com">Astrophiz</a> series of podcasts, in which
he interviews astrophysicists about their work. I met him briefly at the
<a href="/meetings/2024/02/02/transients_down_under.html">Transients Down
Under meeting</a> in January, and and he later arranged an interview which has
now been published as
