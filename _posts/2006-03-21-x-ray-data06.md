      <img src="images/spectra.jpg" align="left">For those in the local Astro group who may have an interest or a need to analyse some X-ray data from <em>Chandra</em> or <em>RXTE</em>, I have installed some analysis software (Linux machines only) and related calibration files in /data/software. For <em>Chandra</em> data analysis I have installed CIAO version 3.3.0.1, as well as the ISIS spectral fitting package version 1.3.1 and the CALDB files. For <em>RXTE</em> analysis I have installed HEASOFT version 6.0.3 and the appropriate CALDB files.<p>
<em>If you missed the introduction to X-ray astronomy I gave on April 5<sup>th</sup>, here is a <a href="http://users.monash.edu.au/~dgallow/docs/X-ray data analysis.pdf">PDF file</a> of the slides and notes</em><p>
To initialise CIAO:<p>
source /data/software/ciao/bin/ciao.csh<p>
For ISIS, add /data/software/isis/bin to your path and invoke with "isis". See the <a href="http://cxc.harvard.edu">CXC</a> for <a href="http://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao">analysis threads and other documentation</a>.<p>
To initialise HEASOFT (which also has general tools to manipulate FITS files) for analysis of <em>RXTE</em> data:<p>
setenv HEADAS /data/software/headas/i686-pc-linux-gnu-libc2.2.4<br>
source $HEADAS/headas-init.csh<br>
setenv CALDB /data/software/caldb<br>
source $CALDB/software/tools/caldbinit.csh<p>
HEASOFT also includes the popular spectral fitting package <a href="http://xspec.gsfc.nasa.gov">Xspec</a>. See the <a href="http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov">HEASARC</a> site for <a href="http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/lheasoft">more info</a> or <a href="http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/xte/xhp_proc_analysis.html">RXTE data analysis recipes</a> <p>
I also plan to install the SAS software for analysis of XMM-Newton data. Let me know if you are interested in getting started with these packages or need any help.
