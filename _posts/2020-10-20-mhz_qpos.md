Millihertz quasi-periodic oscillations (mHz QPOs) observed in neutron-star
low-mass X-ray binaries are generally thought to arise from 
"marginally stable" thermonuclear burning, at the upper limit of 
accretion rates where 
<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ASSL..461..209G">thermonuclear
bursts</a> are possible. A long-standing puzzle is that they seem to occur
at accretion rates about an order of magnitude lower than predicted 
theoretically, and <em>while bursts are still occurring</em>.
</p>
<p>Since no-one knows how you can simultaneously have (quasi-) stable and
unstable burning on the surface of a neutron star (except perhaps
<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.499.2148C/">Yuri Cavecchi</a>), we'd dearly like to 
better understand this phenomenon. Monash PhD student Ka Ho Tse discovered
a new example of mHz QPOs, in the transient 1RXS J180408.9&mdash;342058. While
the properties of the newly-discovered oscillations are similar to the other
seven examples, we now have a good sample of objects to examine the properties
and compare against (for example) numerical models. Ka Ho's preliminary work
suggests the observed amplitude is much higher than would be predicted
theoretically, which presents a challenge for the conventional interpretation.
</p>
<p>
His paper describing the discovery, and exploring some of the implications
for the phenomenon across all sources, has now been published by MNRAS.
