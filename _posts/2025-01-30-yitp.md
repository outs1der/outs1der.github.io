Convenient scheduling and a generous host meant that I was lucky enough to
attend the 
<a href="https://www.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en/about/profile/faculty/research-institutes/yukawa-institute-for-theoretical-physics-yitp">Yukawa
Institute for Theoretical Physics</a> workshop on 
<a href="https://indico.yukawa.kyoto-u.ac.jp/e/xrb2025">Nucleosynthesis
and Evolution of Neutron Stars</a> at Kyoto University, end of this month. 
The workshop featured observers, astro and nuclear theorists, and nuclear
experimentalists, and was supported in part by 
<a href="https://www.irenaweb.org">IReNA</a>. Was great to catch up with
some colleagues' work on thermonuclear bursts, including with the
remarkable 
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03016"><em>NinjaSat</em></a>
satellite. Also lots of presentations and posters about identifying and
investigating key nuclear reactions for thermonuclear bursts.
I gave a talk covering X-ray binaries and focussing on new views of
thermonuclear bursts, including some recent work with matching
observations and numerical models.

<p>I am extremely grateful to the organisers and also the 
<a href="http://www.fpastron.jp">Foundation for Promtion of Astronomy</a>
who supported my travel and local costs.
