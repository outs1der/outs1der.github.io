Our program <em>Precision Ephemeridies for Gravitational wave
Searches</em> (PEGS) posted it's first result this month, with the
publication of refined orbital parameters for the X-ray binary Sco X-1.
This remarkable source was the first X-ray binary ever discovered, and
it's 19&nbsp;hr orbital period was already known to unusually high
precision thanks to 89 years of photometric observations. Thanks to 
<a href="/~dgallow/cgi-bin/blosxom.cgi/gravitational%20waves/lapalma.html">new
spectroscopic measurements</a> from 2011, analysed by Monash PhD student 
<a href="http://monash.edu/science/about/schools/physics/people/students/premachandra.html">Shakya Premachandra</a>,we made a significantly more
precise measurement, and also projected the uncertainties (including the
effects of additional observations) forward into the Advanced LIGO/Virgo
observing epoch. The paper is out this month in the
