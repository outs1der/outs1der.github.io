      <img src="/images/bubbles.jpg" width="100" height="100" align="left">The <a href="http://www.texas06.com">XXIIIth Texas Symposium</a>, held here in Melbourne, concluded last week. All in all a terrific success, with a very interesting program full of great talks by stellar (sorry) attendees. There were plenty of international visitors, many of whom commented on how much they enjoyed their visit despite the long trip. I managed to catch up with quite  few people I hadn't seen for a while, but for most the social highlight was Thursday's dinner at the <a href="http://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/ngvinternational/placestoeat.html">NGV's Garden Restaurant</a>.
