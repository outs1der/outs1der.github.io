Had a very busy few months early in 2011, including quite a few meetings.
Early in March I headed down to 
<a href="http://www.phillipisland.net.au">Philip Island</a> for the
<a href="http://www.cspa.monash.edu.au/awr7">Astronomy with Radioactivities
VII</a> meeting. Organised by Monash's own
<a href="http://www.maths.monash.edu.au/staff/mlugaro.html">Maria Lugaro</a>,
this series of meetings brings together a wide spectrum of observers and
theorists interested in various aspects of nuclear astrophysics, including
thermonuclear bursts, on which I gave a 
<a href="http://www.mpe.mpg.de/gamma/science/lines/workshops/AwR2011/Galloway.pdf">review talk</a>.
<br>
A week or so later I made a flying visit to Arcadia, CA to attend the
"face-to-face" weekend sessions of the 
<a href="http://www.ligo.org/conferences/lv0311/">joint LSC-VIRGO meeting</a>,
to talk about our 
<a href="/~dgallow/docs/PEGS_mar11.pdf">optical program</a> to improve the
system parameters of candidate
LMXB sources of gravitational radiation.
<br>
End of March saw me in Switzerland taking part in the first of two meetings 
at the 
<a href="http://www.issibern.ch">International Space Science Institute</a>
on the subject of
<a href="http://www.issibern.ch/teams/ns_burster/ISSI_Team">thermonuclear
bursts</a>. We had a very productive meeting and set some important tasks
to help us better understand our observations of these events. I presented
an update on the <a href="/~dgallow/minbar">MIN(i)BAR</a> project.
