I'm in Toulouse this week to attend the 
<a href="http://www.isdc.unige.ch/loft/index.php/meetings/second-loft-science-meeting">second science
meeting</a> dedicated to ESA's proposed 
<a href="http://www.isdc.unige.ch/loft">Large Observatory for X-ray Timing
(LOFT)</a> mission.
Almost a year has passed since the last meeting, and detailed studies by
the various science teams in that time have begun to clarify the observational
prospects offered by the mission. I presented a poster describing some 
simulations of spectral features which might be observed from thermonuclear
bursts.
