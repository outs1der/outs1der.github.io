      Just got back from New Orleans, where I attended the eighth
       <a href="http://www.confcon.com/head2004/head04.php">High-Energy Astrophysics Divisional meeting</a>. The highlight was almost certainly the <a href="http://www.gsfc.nasa.gov/topstory/2004/0908nsmatter.html">detection of 45 Hz burst oscillations in EXO&nbsp;0748-676</a> (see also <a href="http://www.arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0409384">astro-ph/0409384</a>), a much lower frequency than the previous minimum of 270 Hz (for 4U 1916-053). There was lots of other fun stuff going on, as usual. I presented two posters (links to PS files):<br>
<em><a href="/~dgallow/docs/head2004_catalog_sm.ps">Thermonuclear bursts observed by RXTE: The MIT catalog</a><br>
<a href="/~dgallow/docs/head2004_msp-bursts_sm.ps">Thermonuclear bursts from millisecond X-ray pulsars</a>
</em>
