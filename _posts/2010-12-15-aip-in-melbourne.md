The 19<sup>th</sup> Australian Institute of Physics Congress was held last week
right here in Melbourne, so of course I couldn't miss it. I chaired and 
<a href="/~dgallow/docs/AIP congress Dec 2010.pdf">presented</a> in the
astronomy session on Monday, and also caught a few of the gravitational wave
talks. Bruce Allen gave a great plenary session talk on
<a href="http://einstein.phys.uwm.edu">Einstein @ home</a>, the distributed
analysis project for LIGO (and Arecibo pulsar) data. Bruce also stepped in
to give the public lecture on Wednesday evening, the original speaker Jocelyn
Bell-Burnell could not make it. On Thursday we also had a "town hall" style
open session to discuss the LIGO-Australia project.
