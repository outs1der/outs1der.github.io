I am proud and pleased to report 
the award of 
<a href="http://users.monash.edu.au/~hworpel">Hauke W&ouml;rpel</a>'s 
PhD degree was approved last week. Hauke's thesis, entitled 
"Radiation drag on the accretion disk in type-I X-ray bursts" was submitted last October.
His thesis involved analysis of a few thousand
thermonuclear (type-I) X-ray
bursts observed by the 
<a href="http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/xte/"><em>Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer</a></em>, 
showing that the accretion rate seems to increase during the bursts, and
by a substantial amount, up to a factor of 20.
Hauke also undertook numerical SPH modelling of accretion disks under the influence of bursts, with a view to better understanding the dynamics of the disk.
Hauke has already left these shores and is now undertaking postdoctoral 
work at the
<a href="http://www.aip.de">Leibniz-Institut f&uuml;r Astrophysik Potsdam</a>,
where, on arrival, he unexpectedly grew an umlaut.
<em>Congratulations Hauke!</em>
