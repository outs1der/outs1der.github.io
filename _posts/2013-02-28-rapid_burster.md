The Rapid Burster is unique for its so-called type-II X-ray bursts, during
which the X-ray intensity brightens dramatically, and which can recur as often
as every few tens of seconds. The precise mechanism is unknown, but the bursts
are thought to be episodes of enhanced accretion mediated (somehow) by the
magnetic field. 
<a href="http://www.sron.nl">SRON</a> PhD student Tullio Bagnoli has just
completed a study of the <em>type-I</em> (thermonuclear) bursts which are also
seen from the Rapid Burster, which are detected up to an unusually high
accretion rate, compared to the other neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binaries.
In this respect, the Rapid Burster appears similar to the enigmatic source

which suggests that this system may also rotate
unusually slowly. The paper was just accepted by MNRAS
