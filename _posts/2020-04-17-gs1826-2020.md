The "Clocked burster", GS&nbsp;1826&mdash;238 is one of the best studied burst
sources, due to it's (<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJ...818..135C">mostly</a>) consistent and regular bursts. However there's long been some
uncertainty about the fuel composition, with 
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007ApJ...671L.141H">some studies</a>
suggesting metal-rich fuel, and 
<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004ApJ...601..466G">others</a> metal-poor.
(Here by "metals" we mean an <em>even more</em> restrictive set than usually meant by
astronomers, of the CNO nuclei that contribute to steady H-burning prior to ignition).</p>
<p>Now Monash PhD graduate 
<a href="https://astro.natsci.msu.edu/people/zac-johnston">Zac Johnston</a>
has resolved this uncertainty, with the most comprehensive observation-model
comparison to date. He assembled a grid of almost 4000 KEPLER runs and 
performed a comparison to the observational data, via a novel interpolation
scheme which speeds up the calculations by many orders of magnitude.
His results confirm the "metal rich" scenario, and also provide constraints on the source distance and system inclination. His paper was just accepted by MNRAS.
