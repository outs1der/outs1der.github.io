      <img src="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/images/content/188851main1_pulsarplanet_1.jpg" width="100" align="left">Using NASA’s Swift and <em>Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer</em> (<em>RXTE</em>) satellites, astronomers have discovered one of the most bizarre planet-mass objects ever found. The object’s minimum mass is only about 7 times the mass of Jupiter. But instead of orbiting a normal star, this low-mass body orbits a rapidly (182 Hz) spinning pulsar. It orbits the pulsar every 54.7 minutes at an average distance of only about 230,000 miles (slightly less than the Earth-Moon distance). [ from the <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/topstory/2007/millisecond_pulsar.html">NASA press release</a> ]
<br>
As part of a team led by Hans Krimm (Goddard), we analysed the <em>RXTE</em> observations following the discovery of this system, Swift J1756.9-2508. Hans' paper has now been accepted by ApJL and has been posted on <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0709.1693">arXiv.org</a>. The story has shown up in a few places on the web, including the <a href="http://www.monash.edu.au/news/monashmemo/stories/20071017/NASA.html">October 17 Monash Memo</a> and even got a peripheral mention in a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/12/science/space/12cnd-planet.html?_r=1&hp&oref=slogin">NY Times story</a><p>
