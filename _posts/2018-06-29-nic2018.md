The <a href="http://nic2018.lngs.infn.it">15<sup>th</sup> Nuclei in the
Cosmos</a> meeting was held at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory, near
Assergi, Italy. Monash had a pretty good showing with PhD students Adelle
Goodwin, Zac Johnston and Melanie Hampel all in attendance.
I presented a talk bringing together some of our recent work on measuring neutron star properties from thermonuclear bursts.
A highlight was the conference banquet, at the wonderful <a href="http://www.magionepapale.it">Magione Papale</a>, al fresco dining on a beautiful summer's evening topped off with a remarkable fireworks show.</p>

The meeting setting offered a terrific opportunity to explore the area; from the earthquake-damaged (and still not fully recovered) town of L'Aquila, to the mountains and  valleys surrounding the nearby village of Assergi, an unlikely place to find an Australian hotel owner!
