This week I visited Aspen, CO for the 
<a href="http://cargo.ucsc.edu/tasc/aspen">Physics of Astronomical Transients</a> meeting, at the remarkable 
<a href="http://www.aspenphys.org">Aspen Center for Physics</a>. There is an
increasing focus on transient astronomy at present, and astrophysicsts are 
racing to understand the physics of new phenomena that are being
discovered by wide-field, automated instruments and observing programs such
as NASA's <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/swift/main"><em>Swift</em></a>
satellite, the <a href="http://pan-starrs.ifa.hawaii.edu/public/">Pan-STARRS</a>
program, and others. I presented a poster on the 
<a href="http://www.physics.usyd.edu.au/sifa/vast/index.php">Variables and
Slow Transients</a> program for the
<a href="http://www.atnf.csiro.au/projects/askap/">Australian Square Kilometre
Array Pathfinder (ASKAP)</a> which is expected to uncover a wealth of new
transient discoveries when it commences in 2013 or so.
