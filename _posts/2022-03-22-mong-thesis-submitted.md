My warmest congratulations to <a
href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/travis-mong-4709631b0">Yik Lun (Travis)
Mong</a>, who submitted his
thesis today! Travis worked on our <a
href="http://goto-observatory.org">Gravitational-wave Optical Transient
Observer</a> project, and his thesis, entitled "Identification of
Gamma-Ray Burst Optical Counterparts for the Gravitational-wave Optical
Transient Observer with Machine Learning" has now gone out for
examination. Great work Travis!
