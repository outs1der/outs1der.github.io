You may have noticed the 
<a href="https://twitter.com/DuncanKGalloway">Twitter</a> feed embedded on
this page is no longer showing any tweets. Rest assured, I have been
assiduously tweeting, it's just that their <em>own tool</em> no longer
works, as noted
<a href="https://twitter.com/DuncanKGalloway/status/1676917300220362755">here</a>.

Twitter is my primary professional social media site, and while I have
generally not been affected by the recent decline noted by many others,
this is more of an irritation than anything. (I'd previously created a 
<a href="https://fediscience.org/@DuncanKGalloway">Mastodon account</a>
and was happily cross-posting all my Tweets there too, but of course that
stopped working earlier, sometime in February). 
Maybe now time to switch completely to Mastodon...
