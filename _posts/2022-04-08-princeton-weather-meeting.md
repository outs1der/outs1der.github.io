Although the time difference made it difficult to attend the meeting
remotely, I caught a few presentations of the <a
href="https://phy.princeton.edu/events/gipcts-weather-and-climate-neutron-stars-connecting-surface-flow-theory-and-observations">Princeton
GI/PCTS Weather and Climate on Neutron Stars meeting</a> this week (image
to the left is from <a
href="https://www.physics.mcgill.ca/~cumming">Andrew Cumming</a>'s talk). We
often talk about neutron stars having atmospheres and oceans, in which
time-varying flows can occur analogous to the "weather" in Earth's
atmosphere and ocean. The strong surface gravity and (typically) fast
rotation can give rise to extreme consequences of these phenomena, most
notably (for my work) in burst oscillations. I also
made my own presentation on <a

burst observations: status and future prospects"</a> (click for the
video!)
