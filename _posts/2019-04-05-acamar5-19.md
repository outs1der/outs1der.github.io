The <a href="https://acamar.org.au/events/acamar5/register/acamar-5">5<sup>th</sup> Australia-China Workshop on Astrophysics</a>
was held in Healesville, VIC at 
<a href="https://www.racv.com.au/travel-leisure/racv-club/healesville.html">RACV's Country Club resort</a> this April.
The meeting continues a series of events intended to foster cooperation between the two countries, and
as my first attendance, I was very impressed with the level of cooperation
alredy.
A host of prominent Chinese and Australian astronomers were in attendance, and presentations
were also made by students undertaking projects enabled made possible via
cooperative programs.
I gave a talk on X-ray binaries and the possibilities for joint observational
programs, particularly with <a href="http://www.hxmt.org/index.php/enhome">Insight-HXMT</a> and the proposed <a href="https://www.isdc.unige.ch/extp/">eXTP</a>.
Exciting times ahead for cross-country cooperation!
