Regular, mixed H/He thermonuclear bursts have long served as valuable comparisons for
numerical ignition models. Such bursts are observed only from a few systems,
and it remains a mystery why this mode of bursting is so rare. 
<a href="http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=ginga+1826-24&NbIdent=1&Radius=2&Radius.unit=arcmin&submit=submit+id">GS&nbsp;1826-24</a>
is well-known for it's consistently regular bursts, but similarly regular
bursts have also been observed from the long-duration (now quiescent) transient
<a href="http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=ks+1731-260&NbIdent=1&Radius=2&Radius.unit=arcmin&submit=submit+id">KS&nbsp;1731-26</a>. These bursts may also serve as important test-cases for
understanding the burst X-ray spectrum and how it may be used to constrain the
neutron star EOS.<br>
Recently Nathanael Lampe & I published 
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...747...75G">a paper</a> examining the consistency of radius measurements
from samples of highly consistent, regular bursts. We found that the blackbody
normalisation (from which the radius can be determined) can vary significantly
between burst epochs. This may partly be attributed to variations in the
spectral correction factor <em>f<sub>c</sub></em> during some bursts.<br>
In parallel, 
<a href="http://www.physics.mcgill.ca/~mzamfir">Michael Zamfir</a> and 
<a href="http://www.physics.mcgill.ca/~cumming">Andrew Cumming</a> developed
a way to 
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...749...69Z">constrain the surface redshift</a>, and hence the neutron star mass and
radius based on these bursts. (I had done something similar on the bursts from
KS&nbsp;1731-26 a few years ago with a 3rd-year student at Monash, Richard Linossi, but
Michael & Andrew took this approach much further). There remains a lot of 
uncertainty about how best to extract meaningful measurements from bursts, but
we are beginning to better understand the systematics that affect this
approach. This is also timely as other groups have already derived mass and
radius constraints from KS&nbsp;1731-26
