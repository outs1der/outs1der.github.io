      <img src="/images/lightcurves.gif" width="100" height="100" align="left">Alex's paper comparing the observed burst lightcurves from GS&nbsp;1826-24 with time-dependent models of nuclear burning is finally out. The correspondence is really remarkable, and confirms the solar composition of the accreted fuel, as we suspected from the <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2004ApJ...601..466G&db_key=AST&high=3f7869674c20002">2004 paper</a>. However, in that paper we found that the drop in recurrence time with increased flux was more than predicted by Andrew's ignition models; this discrepancy is resolved with the new modelling, which indicates that thermal/compositional inertia play a role in setting the ignition column.
