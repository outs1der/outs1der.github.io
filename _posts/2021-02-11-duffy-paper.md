So-called AM CVn systems are the cataclysmic variables (CVs) with the shortest
orbital periods, down to as short as 5 minutes. CVs in turn are binary systems
consisting of a white dwarf accreting from a low mass companion. These systems
are the white dwarf analogue of low-mass X-ray binaries, and exhibit much 
behaviour that is qualitatively similar, including accretion outbursts.

Chris Duffy used data from 
<a href="http://goto-observatory.org">GOTO</a> as well as several other 
sky surveys to examine the behaviour of a group of systems with basically 
identical orbital periods. Chris found that despite the common orbital periods,
the outbursting behaviour was quite diverse, which has implications for the
disk instability model thought to drive this behaviour. </p>
<p>Chris' paper was just accepted by MNRAS.</p>
