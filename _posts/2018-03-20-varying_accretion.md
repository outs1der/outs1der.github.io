<p>Thermonuclear burst modelling has to date focused on stable accretion rates,
but bursts are also observed during episodes of transient accretion.  The
accretion-powered millisecond pulsar SAX&nbsp;J1808.4&mdash;3658
exhibited 
four helium-rich X-ray bursts during the
outburst of 2002 October.
Monash student Zac Johnston undertook
the first multizone simulations of X-ray
bursts throughout the outburst, incorporating a time-varying accretion rate, to try to match the observations.
The
model, with an accreted hydrogen fraction of X =" 0.44" and a CNO metallicity of
0.02, reproduces the observed burst arrival times and fluences well, and offers the prospects of more detailed future simulations of such outbursts.
Zac's paper reporting the modeling has now been accepted by MNRAS.
