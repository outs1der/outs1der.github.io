The <a href="http://arc.gov.au">Australian Research Council</a> announced
this morning the outcomes of the 
<a href="http://www.arc.gov.au/arc-centres-excellence">Centres of Excellence</a>
scheme, and I'm delighted to report that our Centre for Gravitational Wave
Discovery, aka OzGRav, was approved! The Centre, led by Swinburne's 
<a href="http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/staff/mbailes.html">Prof. Matthew Bailes</a>,
will support research into detecting gravitational waves with interferometric
detectors like <a href="http://www.ligo.org">Advanced LIGO</a> as well as
the <a href="http://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/pulsar/ppta">Parkes Pulsar Timing Array</a>. Nineteen Chief Investigators from six Australian universities will
join with 15 partners from Australia and all over the world, in a program
extending for the next 7 years. A great time to be a gravitational wave astronomer!
