      <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/outsider1/2429587955/" title="Centraal Station by outsider, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3228/2429587955_b4e63a4dc3_t.jpg" width="100" height="75" alt="Centraal Station" align="left" /></a>I just got back from a very busy trip around the US, with a stop in Amsterdam on the way home. I presented a couple of posters at the <a href="http://www.confcon.com/head2008">AAS/High Energy Astrophysics Division Meeting</a> in Los Angeles, and went on to visit <a href="http://www.pa.msu.edu/~ebrown/">Ed Brown</a> at <a href="http://www.jinaweb.org">JINA</a>, where I gave a lunch talk on the following Monday.<p>
Then it was on to Boston for a brief visit to <a href="http://space.mit.edu">MIT</a> to catch up with collaborators and friends, as well as a pilgrimage to <a href="http://www.tosci.com">Toscaninis</a> (sadly the Harvard Square location has closed).
After that I had a couple of nights in St. Louis for the APS meeting, and gave an invited talk on burst observations in a special session on <a href="http://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/APR08/sessionindex2/?SessionEventID=83316">the physics of X-ray bursts (L3)</a>.<p>
Finally I headed home via Amsterdam for another invited talk at the <a href="http://www.astro.uva.nl/xray/amxp">Decade of Accreting Millisecond X-ray Pulsars</a> workshop at UvA.
