Our 
<a href="http://goto-observatory.org">Gravitational-wave Optical Transient Observer</a> 
telescope prototype project was in the news this month, following up a 
<a href="http://goto-observatory.org/wiki/index.php?n=Public.2015Workshop">1-day workshop</a> 
held in April to
introduce the project to the Australian community. Warwick team members
Danny Steeghs, Tom Marsh and Krzysztof Ulaczyk made the long trip down under
to attend, and Danny introduced the project while Krzysztof discussed his
experiences with his previous project,
<a href="http://ogle.astrouw.edu.pl">OGLE</a>.
The workshop was a big success, attracting attendees and speakers from all
over the country, who presented work on a wide range of great transient
science &mdash; from fast radio bursts to supernovae.
