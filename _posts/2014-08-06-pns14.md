The <a href="http://www.ioffe.ru/astro/NS2014">Physics of Neutron Stars</a>
meeting is held approximately every three years, and honors prominent Soviet
physicist
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakov_Borisovich_Zel'dovich">Yakov
Zel'dovich</a>. The conference talks and posters covered a very wide range
of topics relevant to neutron stars, from pulsar emission mechanisms to
magnetars and supernova explosions. I gave a talk on 
observations of thermonuclear bursts. The organisers offered a cultural program
including excursions to prominent attractions in this beautiful city; I chose
to visit the 
<a href="http://eng.tzar.ru">Catherine Palace and park</a>, with a boat ride
of the extensive canal network to follow. Very nice conference in a terrific
venue.
