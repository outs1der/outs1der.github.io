Laurens has just posted a nice paper looking at short recurrence time
thermonuclear (type-I) bursts as seen by <em>RXTE</em> and
<em>BeppoSAX</em>. These bursts occur after waiting times of as short as a
few minutes, which is not sufficient to reach the critical conditions for
ignition. The likely explanation is that the bursts ignite from fuel
leftover from the previous event, but the details remain a bit of a
mystery. Interestingly, short recurrence time bursts are not seen from
sources (or candidate sources) that accrete primarily He. The paper was
just accepted by ApJ.
