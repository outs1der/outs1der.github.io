This week <a href="http://goto-observatory.org">GOTO</a> postdoctoral
researcher and control system guru 
<a href="https://www.martindyer.net">Martin Dyer</a> presented two papers
at the (virtual) 
<a href="https://spie.org/conferences-and-exhibitions/astronomical-telescopes-and-instrumentation">SPIE Astronomical Telescopes + Instumentation 2020</a>
meeting.
Like many 2020 meetings, this one had a challenging path to actually 
occurring, moving twice
(from to Japan to California) and finally to the fully online format.

<p>Martin's 
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02685">first paper</a> offers a brief
summary of the project, describing the 
hardware, software and future plans including the new "GOTO-South" node
to be constructed at 
<a href="https://www.sidingspringobservatory.com.au">Siding Spring Observatory, NSW</a>.
The <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02686">second paper</a> describes
development of the "G-TeCS" control system, which was much of Martin's
thesis project, and serves as the critical "nervous system" of the 
facility, without which we could not operate.</p>
