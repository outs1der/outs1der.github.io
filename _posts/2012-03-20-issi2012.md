March saw me back in Switzerland taking part in the second of two meetings 
at the 
<a href="http://www.issibern.ch">International Space Science Institute</a>
on the subject of
<a href="http://www.issibern.ch/teams/ns_burster/ISSI_Team">thermonuclear
bursts</a>. 
The meeting was a lot more focused than the first and we made plenty of
progress towards our project goals. I was tasked with preparing a catalog of
long (intermediate-duration) bursts which is already taking shape on the team
wiki.
Highlights of the trip were the excursion to 
<a href="http://www.la-gruyere.ch/en/welcome.cfm">Gruyeres</a>
and <a href="http://www.cailler.ch">Maison Cailler</a>, the home of some
spectacularly good chocolate!
