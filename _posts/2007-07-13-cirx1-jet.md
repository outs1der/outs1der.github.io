      <img src="/images/cirx1_jet.jpg" width="100" height="100" align="left">Sebastian did well to spot the X-ray jet in one of Norbert's 2005 zero-phase observations of the enigmatic X-ray binary Cir&nbsp;X-1. This source is thus the first neutron star for which an extended X-ray jet has been detected. Previously ultrarelativistic arcsecond-scale radio jets were detected by Rob Fender's group; see their <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?2004Natur.427..222F">2004 Nature paper</a>. The kinetic jet power that we infer is significantly larger than the minimum power required for the jet to inflate the large-scale radio nebula.
