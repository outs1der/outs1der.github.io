      The burst catalog paper has just been accepted by ApJS! The referee report, by a <em>team</em> of referees, stretched to 11 pages; it took quite a while to address all the (generally constructive) criticisms. In addition, the authors, all at MIT when the project started, are now scattered to the four corners of the US (as well as Australia). The accepted version is (I think) a big improvement on the original, the extra time spent has really helped our understanding of the global burst properties.
