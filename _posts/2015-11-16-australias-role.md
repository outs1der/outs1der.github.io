The first observations by a worldwide network of advanced interferometric
gravitational wave detectors offer a unique opportunity for the astronomical
community. At design sensitivity, these facilities will be able to detect
coalescing binary neutron stars to distances approaching 400 Mpc, and neutron
star-black hole systems to 1 Gpc.
<a href="http://www.ejhowell.com">Eric Howell</a>'s paper, recently accepted by the 
<a href="http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayJournal?jid=PAS">Publications of the Astronomical Society of Australia</a>, describes 
how Australian astronomical facilities and collaborations with the gravitational wave community can contribute to this new era of discovery, via contemporaneous follow-up observations from the radio to the optical and high energy.
