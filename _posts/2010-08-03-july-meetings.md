This July was a very busy month for meetings. It kicked off with the
annual <a href="http://www-ra.phys.utas.edu.au/ASA2010">Astronomical
Society of Australia</a> meeting which was held this year in my old home
town of Hobart,
Tasmania. I presented some preliminary results from the PEGS project in a
talk titled
<a href="/~dgallow/docs/COSPAR 2010 H02-0030-01.pdf">"Tuning up for Gravitational Wave detection in Accreting Neutron Stars"</a>.
As is traditional the 
<a href="http://www-ra.phys.utas.edu.au/ASA2010/hwws.html">Harley Wood
Winter School</a> was held the weekend before; the theme was "Powerful
Objects" and I gave a talk on 
<a href="/~dgallow/docs/HWWS 2010.pdf">accretion-powered neutron stars</a>.
Back to Melbourne for a week, and then off to Bremen, Germany for 
<a href="http://www.cospar2010.org/">cospar<sup>10</sup></a>. I revised my 
<a href="/~dgallow/docs/COSPAR 2010 H02-0030-01.pdf">ASA talk</a> in 
<a
href="http://www.cospar-assembly.org/admin/session.php?session=216">Event
H02</a>, and also gave a talk on the 
<a href="http://users.monash.edu.au/~dgallow/2009/10/its-deja-vu-all-over-again.html">discovery of burst oscillations in EXO 0748-676</a> in 
<a
href="http://www.cospar-assembly.org/admin/session.php?session=168">Event
E13</a> as well as presenting a poster on <a
href="/~dgallow/minbar">MINBAR</a>.<br>
Then it was off to Leiden, NL for the 
<a
href="http://www.lorentzcenter.nl/lc/web/2010/408/info.php3?wsid=408">Lorentz
Center workshop on X-ray bursts and burst oscillations</a>, where I gave
an invited talk on the
<a href="/~dgallow/docs/Lorentz Center Workshop '10.pdf">status of burst
observations</a>. The workshop was a terrific event, an excellent chance
to catch up with colleagues (see the 
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/andrew_cumming/4850910653/">group photo</a>)
and see the state-of-the-art of burst research, as well as 
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/xrbworkshop2010/">see a bit of
Leiden</a>.
