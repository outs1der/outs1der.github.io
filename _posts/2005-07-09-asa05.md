One of the highlights was the launch, and review discussion, of the NCA's <a href="http://www.atnf.csiro.au/nca/decadal_plan.html">Decadal Plan</a> for the period 2006-15. I presented a talk on some millisecond pulsar work, as well as Jasmina's talk on G347.3-0.5 (she unfortunately couldn't attend).<br clear="left">
