My first active week (after recovering from a bad cold/flu) in NL I
attended the <a href="https://indico.kna-rnas.nl/event/1">Netherlands
Astronomy Conference</a> in lovely Berg en Dal, hosted by the 
<a href="https://www.ru.nl/en/departments/institute-for-mathematics-astrophysics-and-particle-physics/astrophysics">Radboud
Department of Astrophysics</a>.
The conference was great with lots of interesting talks, and a wonderful
opportunity for a comprehensive overview of astronomy activities here. 
My registration payment also gave me the opportunity to join the 
<a href="https://www.kna-rnas.nl">Koninklijke Nederlandse Astronomenclub,
KNA</a>.

I
gave a talk on <a href="http://goto-observatory.org">GOTO</a> in the
(inaugural) instrumentation session, and also presented a 
<a href="/docs/NW3-8_Galloway_Duncan.pdf">poster</a> on some
ongoing burst work.
Also a great opportunity to meet old friends and colleagues, and new.

Due
to a late cancellation I also had the opportunity to give the colloquium
at Radboud the following week, which covered similar ground to my NAC
presentations but gave substantially more time to describe them.
