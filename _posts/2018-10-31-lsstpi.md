The <a href="https://www.lsst.org">Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST)</a>
is a truly impressive instrument for the next decade. The 8.4m telescope will
illuminate a 3200 Mpix camera, and carry out a 10-year survey of the sky
expected to provide millions of transient alerts... every night. 
Many astronomers in Australia are keen to get their hands on the data which 
is expected to start flowing around 2023. 
The Australian Science Lead, 
<a href="https://www.physics.unsw.edu.au/staff/sarah-brough">Sarah Brough (UNSW)</a> along with
<a href="http://www.astronomyaustralia.org.au">Astronomy Australia Ltd.</a> 
is coordinating a joint national membership which would allow access to the
data for Australian astronomers, and this week my application to be one of the
Principal Investigators was approved!
Next step is to join one (or more) of the science groups and think about
all the fun we can have when the telescope comes on-line. 
I'm also hoping to attend theaupcoming 
<a href="https://lsst-asia.org">LSST@Asia</a> meeting in Sydney, 20&mdash;23 May 2019.
