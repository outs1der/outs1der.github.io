This month I visited South Africa (and the African continent for the first
time!) to attend the 
<a href="http://iaus339.ast.uct.ac.za">Southern Horizons in Time-Domain
Astronomy</a> meeting in 
<a href="https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Stellenbosch">Stellenbosch</a>.
The programme featured an exhaustive roster of hot topics in the transient
realm right now &mdash; from kilonovae through FRBs to supernovae and stellar
pulsations.
A wide range of instrument development activities were reported, both 
world-wide and in South Africa, which is of course the host of the
<a href="https://www.salt.ac.za">Southern African Large Telescope (SALT)</a>
and the Square Kilometer Array precursor
<a href="http://www.ska.ac.za/gallery/meerkat">MeerKAT</a>
As well there were workshops on relevant topics including astroinformatics
and machine learning. 
The setting, in the midst of SA's 
<a href="http://www.wineroute.co.za">wine regions</a> was pretty hard to beat,
and the chance to visit Cape Town &mdash; surely one of the most geographically
stunning cities in the world &mdash; was a nice bonus.
The program and most of the talks are now online so check it out!
