In January I was back to Europe for the
<a href="http://www.brera.inaf.it/utenti/campana/xrb13">X-ray Binaries 13</a>
meeting, a "thinkshop" on the present and future of studies of X-ray binaries
organised by 
<a href="http://www.brera.inaf.it/~campana/webpage/sergio">Sergio Campana</a>
(Brera) &co. The meeting featured a terrific overview of the current state
of knowledge of neutron star and black hole binaries, and prospects for
the future. I gave an invited talk on thermonuclear bursts and the prospects
for the future.</p>
<p>
Of course, in a setting as beautiful as 
<a href="http://www.bormio.com">Bormio</a>, we also enjoyed the skiing,
although it did get a bit cold (-20&deg; at the summit at one point!)</p>
