I'm delighted to welcome a new postdoctoral associate to the Monash 
<a href="http://goto-observatory.org">GOTO</a> team, 
<a href="https://jimenez-ibarra.wixsite.com/felipeji">Felipe
Jiminez-Ibarra</a>. Felipe brings his expertise on optical observations of
X-ray binaries and will be focussing on the commissioning and use of our
GOTO network, including our soon-to-be deployed instrument at 
<a href="https://www.sidingspring.com.au">Siding Spring Observatory</a>,
NSW.
