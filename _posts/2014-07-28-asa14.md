<a href="http://asa.astronomy.org.au/asa.html">Astronomical Society of
Australia</a> held its
<a href="http://www.asa2014.mq.edu.au">Annual Scientific Meeting</a> at 
<a href="http://mq.edu.au">Macquarie University</a> in Sydney, NSW this month.
A notable inclusion to the program was the presentation, on Tuesday,
of the draft reports to the 
<a href="">National Committee for Astronomy</a> for the
<a href="/~dgallow/cgi-bin/blosxom.cgi/meetings/decadalplan.html">Decadal
Plan 2016&mdash;2025</a>. Eleven
<a href="http://australianastronomydecadalplan.org/home/working-groups-2">working groups</a>
(including the group I chair, WG1.4: High energy and fundamental
astrophysics)
have been consulting broadly via community meetings since February, and
this week offered the first opportunity for broad community review of, and
feedback for, the draft reports.
The session went very well and there is (I believe) a sense that the level of
community interaction in this process has been extremely inclusive, so
that all stakeholders have been represented.
I also gave a talk on the Friday describing a new project aimed at closing
the loop between thermonuclear burst observations, modelling, and nuclear
experiments, which for the moment I've given the acronym NAGA*.
An unusual inclusion in the social program was the opening of an art
exhibition,
<a href="http://mq.edu.au/newsroom/2014/07/18/new-exhibition-captures-astronomy-as-art-fields-of-vision-art-and-astronomy/">Fields
of Vision: Art and Astronomy</a> which was a very civilized addition.
The dinner, at the lovely 
<a href="http://www.curzonhall.com.au">Curzon hall</a>, was terrific.
