Being based for the moment in EU I took the advantage of attending a
couple of appealing topical meetings this June. First up was the 
<a href="http://xrayuniverse.esa.int">X-ray Universe '23</a> meeting in
Athens, Greece, held at the lovely 
<a hgref="https://www.eef.edu.gr/en/the-foundation/planetarium/the-new-digital-planetarium">Eugenides Foundation Digital Planetarium</a>.
It was great to hear about new results from 
<a href="https://ixpe.msfc.nasa.gov">IXPE</a>, launched just over 18
months ago, and now with an impressive set of polarisation measurements on
a wide range of sources to report. Excitement is building for the upcoming
<a href="https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/einstein-probe">Einstein Probe</a>
and
<a href="https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/xrism">XRISM</a> missions,
both planned for launch in 2023. And finally the 
<a href="https://www.the-athena-x-ray-observatory.eu/en">Athena</a>
mission saw frequent mention, following the 
<a href="https://www.the-athena-x-ray-observatory.eu/en/blog/athena-status">excessive cost</a>
identified last year, which has motivated a reassessment and (moderate)
downgrading of some of the capabilities. The "NewAthena" mission will be
reassessed in November.</p>

I travelled by bus, ferry and train over the weekend to Italy, for
the 
<a href="https://astro.dur.ac.uk/vam2023">First Vasto Accretion Meeting</a>
held in the lovely 
<a href="http://www.museipalazzodavalos.it">Palazzo d'Avalos</a> up on the
hill overlooking the marina and beach. A terrific program of talks
featured great results on accretion at a wide range of scales, from AGN to
white dwarfs and neutron stars. The social program was also first rate
with plenty of opportunities for networking and enjoying the beautiful
surroundings. Hopefully the first of many future meetings!
