Gamma-ray bursts, particularly poorly-localised ones, are a secondary
science priority for our <a href="http://goto-observatory.org">GOTO</a>
network of telescopes, after binary neutron-star mergers. While we've
<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.507.5463M">followed
up many such events</a>, up until late last year we'd been unsuccessful in
actually discovering an optical counterpart.</p>
<p>This all changed with
<a href="https://gcn.nasa.gov/circulars/34652">GRB230911A</a>, detected
last September, and for which Monash PhD student Sergey Belkin identified
the optical afterglow (reported first in
<a href="https://gcn.nasa.gov/circulars/34681">GCN #34681</a>). This
discovery was significant in several respects; it included observations
from both our northern and southern instruments (the latter was deployed
only a few months earlier), and was an emphatic demonstration of the
effectiveness of our automated screening, with just one candidate
left over for human review. Sergey reported the discovery in a 
<a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2515-5172/ad1876">research
note</a>, which has now been published by IOP.</p>
<p>Hopefully the first of many more!</p>

we've been unsuccessful in 
GRB 230307A was an exceptionally bright long-duration gamma-ray burst
first detected by the <a href="https://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov"><em>Fermi</em></a>
Gamma-ray Burst Monitor on 7 March.  Such events are usually understood to
arise from the supernova of a massive star; unexpectedly, optical followup
indicated behaviour similar to a kilonova, until now associated with
<em>short-duration</em> bursts (which are thought to arise instead from
compact object mergers, like the famous
<a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GW170817">GW170817</a>). </p>
<p><a href="https://www.ru.nl/en/people/levan-a">Andrew Levan</a> and
collaborators carried out extensive optical imaging and spectroscopy
following the event, which I played an infinitessimally small role in.
Most excitingly, the campaign also found a spectral line feature in JWST
mid-IR spectrum, possibly arising from Tellurium produced (presumably
along with other heavy elements) during the event. The 
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06759-1">paper</a> has
now been accepted by Nature and is also available at 
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02098">arXiv:2307.02098</a>.</p>
