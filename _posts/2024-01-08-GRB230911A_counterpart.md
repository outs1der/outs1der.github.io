Gamma-ray bursts, particularly poorly-localised ones, are a secondary
science priority for our <a href="http://goto-observatory.org">GOTO</a>
network of telescopes, after binary neutron-star mergers. While we've
<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.507.5463M">followed
up many such events</a>, up until late last year we'd been unsuccessful in
actually discovering an optical counterpart.</p>
<p>This all changed with
<a href="https://gcn.nasa.gov/circulars/34652">GRB230911A</a>, detected
last September, and for which Monash PhD student Sergey Belkin identified
the optical afterglow (reported first in
<a href="https://gcn.nasa.gov/circulars/34681">GCN #34681</a>). This
discovery was significant in several respects; it included observations
from both our northern and southern instruments (the latter was deployed
only a few months earlier), and was an emphatic demonstration of the
effectiveness of our automated screening, with just one candidate
left over for human review. Sergey reported the discovery in a 
<a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2515-5172/ad1876">research
note</a>, which has now been published by IOP.</p>
<p>Hopefully the first of many more!</p>
