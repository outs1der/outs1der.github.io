The first accretion-powered millisecond pulsar ever found,
SAX&nbsp;1808.4&mdash;3658 is a remarkable object, also showing thermonuclear
bursts during it's infrequent outbursts. Over several years PhD student <a
href="https://twitter.com/astro_del">Adelle Goodwin</a> has
been trying to match the bursts observed during it's 2002 outburst with 
the predictions of a numerical model.
This exercise can be thought of as 
searching exhaustively for a set of parameters which (in the model) reproduce
the observed properties of the bursts.
Now that we have 
<a href="/~dgallow/cgi-bin/blosxom.cgi/postgrads/xtej1812-182.html">an improved 
formula</a> for determining the energy of these bursts, she built a 
<a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/a-zero-math-introduction-to-markov-chain-monte-carlo-methods-dcba889e0c50">Markov-chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC)</a> code
to constrain system parameters including neutron star mass and radius for
the source. Her paper describing the study, and it's results, has now been
published by
MNRAS
