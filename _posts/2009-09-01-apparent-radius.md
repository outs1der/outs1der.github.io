      <img src="/images/measure-tgt-1-web.jpg" width="100" height="100" align="left">Measuring the radius of neutron stars is hard &mdash; ask anyone. (They're really small, and really far away; imagine trying to measure something the width of a human hair... on Pluto). The X-ray emission during the bursts seems to come from the entire surface, and is consistent with a blackbody, so it should be possible to infer the radius indirectly, but the apparent radius behaves in very unexpected ways &mdash; usually increasing or decreasing during the burst. <a href="http://web.tifr.res.in/~sudip/">Sudip Bhattacharyya</a> & Cole Miller found a correlation between the slope of the radius evolution and the duration of the burst (a proxy for the burst fuel composition), based on the data from the <em>RXTE</em> burst catalog. Our paper was just accepted by MNRAS.
