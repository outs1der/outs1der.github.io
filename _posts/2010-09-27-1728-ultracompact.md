Thermonuclear bursts that show photospheric radius-expansion (PRE)  are 
pretty rare in most sources, so much so that <em>Chandra</em> has only
observed a few of them in a decade of observations. In 2006 we made an
observation of a prolific PRE burster, 4U&nbsp;1728-34, to try to catch some
bursts and search for spectral features near the peak. We got plenty of
bursts, but only 4 of them were likely PRE, and we saw no features. But, we
did find evidence for an extremely weak periodic variation in the X-ray
intensity, which if orbital in nature, means the neutron star orbits its
mass donor once every 10.77 minutes! Our paper was just accepted by ApJ, and
is available at <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1009.2296">arXiv:1009.2296</a>.
