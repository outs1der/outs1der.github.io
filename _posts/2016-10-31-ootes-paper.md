Some thermonuclear burst sources exhibit temporary "burst oscillations", 
periodic variations in the X-ray intensity at frequencies characteristic
of each source. It has been shown that these oscillaions trace the neutron 
star spin, but much is still not known about the detailed mechanism, and
many puzzles remain.

a comprehensive study of the oscillations detected in the entire

Timing Explorer</em></a>
sample, which has just been accepted for publication by ApJ. 
The paper presents a comprehensive comparison of the observed properties
with burst oscillation models, as summarised in a series of 14 (!)

we still cannot unambiguously identify the oscillation mechanism, this 
analysis is going to be definitive for many years, until a new X-ray timing
mission is launched.
