This week I attended the 
<a href="https://transientsdownunder.github.io">Transients Down Under</a>
meeting hosted by 
<a href="http://swinburne.edu">Swinburne U.</a>. Really nice program and a
great bunch of old and new colleagues all interested in various kinds of
transients. Testament to the growth of the community here in Australia
over the last decade or so. Parallel sessions made it difficult to attend
everything I wanted, and the lack of an online option was a little
frustrating, as the original presenter for our 
<a href="http://goto-observatory.org">GOTO</a> talk couldn't make it back
to Australia for the meeting.</p>
<p>The program featured a good showing from Monash including PhD student
Sergey Belkin presenting his latest result on the 
<a

discovery of a GRB optical counterpart with GOTO</a>.</p>
