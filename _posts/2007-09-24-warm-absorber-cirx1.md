      <img src="images/depth.jpg" width="100" height="100" align="left">Norbert's paper on the faint-state observations of Cir&nbsp;X-1 has just been accepted to ApJ. While the P-Cygni lines (present in earlier observations when the source was brighter) were absent, we found evidence for complex absorption effects, including warm (moderately ionized) absorbers with varying column density. This <em>Chandra</em> observation has proved popular lately, with <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0709.0190">another paper</a> analysing the same data posted just weeks earlier.
