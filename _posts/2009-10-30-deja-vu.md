      <img src="images/0748-676.jpg" width="100" align="left">Our recent discovery of 552&nbsp;Hz burst oscillations in the well-known binary EXO&nbsp;0748-676 was fairly unremarkable, except perhaps for the extreme rarity of the oscillations (detected in only 2 of ~160 bursts observed by <em>RXTE</em>). However, oscillations had <em>already</em> been detected in this source back in 2004, at 45&nbsp;Hz. The 552&nbsp;Hz signal is much stronger, recommending it as the neutron star spin; unfortunately, the Doppler broadening that would be expected by such a spin means that the narrow spectral features previously identified as arising from the neutron star surface, could not have. Our paper has now (Feb '10) been accepted by ApJL.
