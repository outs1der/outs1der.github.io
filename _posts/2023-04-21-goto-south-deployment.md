One of the most exciting events of my entire career was seeing the new
<a href="http://goto-observatory.org">GOTO network</a> instruments
deployed at 
<a href="https://www.sidingspring.com.au">Siding Spring Observatory</a>
this month. A team from the northern hemisphere comprising colleagues from
<a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/research/astro">Warwick
U.</a> and personnel from the telescope manufacturer 
<a href="https://www.astrosysteme.com">ASA</a>, as well as Monash postdocs
installed both sets of instruments in the first week on site. The
installation went very smoothly (actually completed one day early!) with
installation and commissioning activities continuing for the next month.

<p>
Of course there were a few delays with networking equipment failure and
the larger issue of internet reliability and connection to the outside
world, but there are fixes in the pipeline, and at this point the hardware
is performing well.</p>
<p>
We're hoping to use this new instrument in concert with it's twin on La
Palma to follow up events detected during the next

run</a>!
