Every ten years the Australian astronomy community collaborates to produce
a plan covering the next decade. The 
<a href="http://science.org.au/natcoms/nc-astronomy.html">National Committee
for Astronomy</a> kicked the planning for the period 2016&mdash;25 off last
year, and teams of working groups are already busy preparing their
submissions. As part of the process, there will be a series of 
<a href="http://australianastronomydecadalplan.org/home/town-hall-meetings/">"town-hall" style meetings</a>
to allow interested individuals and groups to provide input to the planning
process. The first such meeting will be held next Friday, 14<sup>th</sup> 
February, here at Monash, and will cover working groups 1.2 (stars and planets)
and 1.4 (high energy and fundamental astrophysics, which I chair).
Please come along and 
have your say about the future direction of astronomy in Australia!
