      <img src="images/Perth_SP_crop_web.jpg" width="100" align="left">The annual meeting of the <a href="http://asa.astronomy.org.au/">Astronomical Society of Australia</a> was held this July in Perth, WA. I've never spent much time in Perth, so it was good to spend a little time over there. The <a href="http://www.uwa.edu.au/">UWA</a> campus at Crawley is beautiful, right on the shore of the Swan river, and with fantastic architecture and gardens. We stayed at <a href="http://www.stgeorgescollege.com.au">St. George's College</a>, which is also very picturesque, and backs onto King's Park. The meeting was very well attended  and a lot of fun. I gave an invited talk on searches for spectral features from radius-expansion bursts observed by <em>RXTE</em><p>
