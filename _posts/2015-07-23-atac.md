My last appearance on the 
<a href="http://www.atnf.csiro.au/management/tac">Australia Telescope Time Assignment Committee</a>
surprisingly was accompanied by an 
<a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-07-22/astronomers-decide-telescope-access/6639756">ABC News story</a>
on the role and operation of the committee. I really enjoyed my time on the
TAC, despite the workload and deadlines; it's great to have such a broad
overview of how our community chooses to utilise the national resources
available to them. The other TAC members have been great fun to work with,
and the 
<a href="http://www.atnf.csiro.au">ATNF</a>
staff are always helpful and responsive. I may have even learned
a little about radio astronomy, although no proposals from me... yet!
