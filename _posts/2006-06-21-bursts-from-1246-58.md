      Some activity recently from an old <em>Ariel V</em> source, 1A&nbsp;1246-588. It's listed in <a href="http://simbad.harvard.edu/sim-id.pl?protocol=html&Ident=1a+1246-588">SIMBAD</a> as a high-mass binary, but recent optical observations instead <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0601045">suggest that it is an ultracompact binary</a> with a very low-mass donor. Then, in late May, the <a href="http://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=830"><em>RXTE</em>/ASM detected a flare</a>, which <a href="http://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=837">subsequent analysis</a> showed to be consistent with a long thermonuclear burst. (An earlier burst was detected by <a href="http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iauc/06500/06538.html#Item2"><em>BeppoSAX</em></a>). These types of bursts occur in very low-accretion rate sources where a deep fuel layer can build up prior to ignition. There are only a handful of ultracompact binaries in the Galaxy, and substantial interest in their properties and evolution.<p>
