      <img src="images/mercury.jpg" align="left" height="100" width="100" />On November 9<sup>th</sup> we had a fun morning following the progress of the <a href="http://www.astronomy.org.au/ngn/engine.php?SID=1000011&AID=100283">transit of Mercury</a>. We climbed up onto the roof of the Physics building before dawn, but sadly missed first and second contact. Later on we moved down to the court east of the Student Union, where we had a steady stream of onlookers curious about what we were doing with a large telescope and an assortment of whiteboards. My own <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/outsider1/sets/72157594404955522/">photos</a> of the projected image didn't come out too well, but Ivy's were much better, and she put together this <a href="http://astro.ph.unimelb.edu.au/pictures/mercury.pdf">composite image</a> illustrating Mercury's progress across the disk of the sun.<p>
