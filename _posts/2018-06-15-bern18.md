This month I hosted the 
<a href="https://burst.sci.monash.edu/bern18">Burst Environments, Reactions and Numerical modelling workshop</a> at Monash's <a href="http://monash.it">Prato Centre</a>, near Florence.
Inspired by a series of <a href="http://www.issibern.ch">ISSI</a> international teams over the last few years, the meeting featured a selected group of attendees with the goal of bringing together researchers working on observational, numerical and nuclear experimental investigations of thermonuclear (type I) bursts.
The centre proved an excellent venue for the great presentations and discussions we had over the week. I'm very grateful to 
<a href="https://www.jinaweb.org">JINA-CEE</a> and
<a href="http://www.monash.edu/moca">MoCA</a> for sponsoring the event,
as well as the <a href="https://burst.sci.monash.edu/bern18/contact.html">organising committee</a> as well as <a href="https://twitter.com/astro_del?lang=en">Adelle</a> and Zac for the website and their help organising.
Hopefully these meetings will continue further, perhaps in Leiden in 2019!
