Thermonuclear (type-I) X-ray bursts arise on the surface of neutron stars in
binary systems, and offer a powerful probe of the neutron star environment
as well as the nuclear reactions that power them.
Efforts to match observed burst to numerical simulations have been fairly
limited to date, partially because of the dearth of high-quality, well
characterised burst measurements. To address this issue, we have assembled
a set of "reference" bursts featuring examples of a number of different types
of bursts, presented in a paper which has just been accepted by 
<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/publications-of-the-astronomical-society-of-australia">PASA</a>.
We also hope that the observed bursts will serve as test cases for numerical
codes in order to assess the variations between those codes, in order to 
quantify the fundamental uncertainty of burst simulations.
