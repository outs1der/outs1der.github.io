      <img src="http://www.alumnitravel.utoronto.ca/images/explore/Holland2006.jpg" width="100" align="left">I just got back from a month-long visit to Europe, spending most of my time working at the <a href="http://www.sron.nl">Space Research Organisation of the Netherlands (SRON)</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utrecht_(city)">Utrecht</a> on some thermonuclear burst work. The goal was to combine the <a href="http://users.monash.edu.au/~dgallow/2006/08/thermonuclear-bursts-observed-by-rxte.html"><em>RXTE</em> burst catalog</a> with the much larger sample accumulated by the Wide-Field Camera onboard the Italian-Dutch <a href="http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/sax/saxgof.html"><em>BeppoSAX</em></a> mission during it's 7-year (1996-2002) mission. We now have a preliminary combined catalog, which we call MINBAR (Multi-INstrument Burst ARchive), and we are working on improving the data products from the <em>BeppoSAX</em> bursts. I also visited the JEM-X instrument team at the <a href="http://spacecenter.dk">Danish National Space Center</a> in order to investigate adding bursts detected by <a href="http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/integral/integralgof.html"><em>INTEGRAL</em></a> to the archive.<br>
But it wasn't <em>all</em> work &mdash; of course, we also had a nice time sightseeing and catching up with friends and family.
