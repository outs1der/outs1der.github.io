This year's <a href="https://indico.fnal.gov/event/15487">meeting</a> (the 8th
in the series!) was held in lovely South Bend, IN. As usual the meeting covered
a wide range of nuclear astrophysics topics as well as the excellent
attendee-driven "unconference" sessions. Donald Clayton gave a great historical
overview in his opening talk. I presented a poster on the progress in our
efforts to reconcile burst models and observations.<br>
We also enjoyed the excellent share bike facilities and the great bike path along the river, conveniently leading the way to the <a href="https://crookedewe.com">Crooked Ewe</a>
