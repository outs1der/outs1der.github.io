This week I'm visiting Coonabarabran to check out <a href="http://www.sidingspringobservatory.com.au">Siding Spring Observatory</a> as a possible site of the southern counterpart of our <a href="http://goto-observatory.org">GOTO</a> instrument on La Palma. Siting a second instrument in Australia willdramatically improve our ability to cover the large sky regions that <a href="http://ligo.org">LIGO</a> produces in response to the detection of a binary neutron star or black hole merger. Later this year we plan to submit a funding proposal to support development of the telescope from 2019 onwards. Stay tuned!
