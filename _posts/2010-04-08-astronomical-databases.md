<a href="http://www.atnf.csiro.au/people/George.Hobbs/">George Hobbs</a> from ATNF
kindly hosted a teleconference for discussion of various approaches and tools
available for astronomical databases. This was motivated by a number of queries
he'd had about the
<a href="http://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/pulsar/psrcat">ATNF Pulsar database</a>
and the related software. There are a variety of possible database management
systems available (including the
<a href="http://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/contents.html#C3">IDL</a> solution I'd been
using to date), so it is good to know a little bit more about their pros and
cons. Also, there is much work being done, some in the context of the various
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Observatory">virtual
observatory</a> efforts, in standardising astronomical data and methods of
public access.  <br clear="left">
Below are some useful links and references that came up in the discussion.
<ul>
<li>Tim Cornwall pointed to <a href="http://www.astrogrid.org">http://www.astrogrid.org</a> which should be (as others also suggested) the first point of contact for making your data available/compatible to/with VO
<li>There is much software already available to view Virtual Observatory compatible data; see the <a href="http://www.euro-vo.org/pub/fc/software.html">VO-Software section</a> at <a href="http://www.euro-vo.org">Euro-VO</a> site, and the <a href="http://ivoa.net">International Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA)</a> for the data standards etc. 
<li><a href="http://www.atnf.csiro.au/people/Emil.Lenc/ATNF_Homepage/Home.html">Emil Lenc</a> is using MySQL to store data related to the Australia Telescope Large Area Survey (ATLAS).  Some suggested that his experience might be the most relevant in terms of people with small datasets wishing to manage them and/or make them public
<li>Russel Jurek (?) stood in for Baerbel Koribalski to talk about the <a href="http://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/multibeam/release">HIPASS public data release</a>; they have a nice webpage 
<li>The other useful reference is last year's <a href="http://www.physics.usyd.edu.au/ioa/ausvoss">Astroinformatics School</a>,  which featured presentations on several topics relevant to this discussion
</ul>
