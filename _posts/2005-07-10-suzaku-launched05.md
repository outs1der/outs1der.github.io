      <img src="http://www.nasa.gov/images/content/117669main_AstroE2_image_small.jpg" width="100" align="left">Suzaku (aka ASTRO-EII) 
successfully entered its intended orbit early this morning (local time),
according to a <a href="http://www.jaxa.jp/press/2005/07/20050710_m-v-6_e.html">JAXA Press Release</a>. All stations (Christmas
island, Santiago, and Uchinoura) have confirmed detection of the signal indicating 
the satellite's separation from the launcher. <br clear="left">
Suzaku, like ASCA, is the name of a legendary bird god. ASTRO-EII is the replacement for the unsuccessful ASTRO-E satellite, <a href="http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/launches/astro_e_failure_000210.html">destroyed shortly following launch</a> in Feburary 2000. ASTRO-EII will cover the energy range 0.2 - 600 keV with the three instruments, X-ray micro-calorimeter (X-ray Spectrometer; XRS), X-ray CCDs (X-ray Imaging Spectrometer; XIS), and the hard X-ray detector (HXD).
The operational status will be confirmed in about 5 days. Congratulations JAXA!<br>
<em>UPDATE</em> Unfortunately, the liquid helium for the cryogenically-cooled XRS <a href="http://www.jaxa.jp/press/2005/08/20050809_suzaku_e.html">unexpectedly evaporated</a> during initial operations, rendering it useless. The active lifetime for this instrument was expected to be 2 years. The ASTRO-EII team are expected to announce a new call for proposals with the remaining science instruments in January.<br>
