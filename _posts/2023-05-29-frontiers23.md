This meeting continues the series begun by 
<a href="https://www.jinaweb.org">Joint Institute for Nuclear
Astrophysics (JINA)</a> under it's various incarnations, but this time
with a new name, the 
<a href="https://indico.frib.msu.edu/event/58">Center for Nuclear
Astrophysics across Messengers (CeNAM)</a>. Along with the new name comes
a broader focus including multimessenger astrophysics, which is timely
given the resumption of gravitational wave observations in the same week.
</p>
<p>
There was plenty of great nuclear physics talks, and I presented (for once not
on thermonuclear bursts, which has been my primary activity
within JINA) but instead on the exciting work on our 
<a href="http://goto-observatory.org">GOTO network</a>. The prospects
for GW counterpart detection have recently had a big boost with the
deployment of our southern node, at Siding Spring Observatory, NSW.
There was also a day-long session focused solely on multimessenger
astrophysics, covering gravitational waves but also neutrinos and cosmic
rays. 
</p>
<p>
But there were a couple of other great talks on bursts, and we managed an
enjoyable "unconference" session on Tuesday to bring everyone up to speed.
