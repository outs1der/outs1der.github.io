Last week I visited Milwaukee for the 
<a href="http://www.gravity.phys.uwm.edu/conferences/gwpaw">Gravitational Wave Physics and Astronomy</a>
workshop, hosted by <a href="http://www4.uwm.edu/letsci/physics/">UWM</a>. This was the continuation of the venerable GWDAW
series of meetings, but the format has been revised somewhat to focus more on 
observations and GW science than the technical aspects of detector development.
For my money it was a big success, and I learned a lot about the candidate
sources for <a href="http://ligo.caltech.edu">LIGO</a> and how we might follow them
up with electromagnetic (optical, X-ray etc.) observations. My own presentation
was on the expected instrumental capabilities in X-rays throughout the
Asvanced-LIGO epoch. And, of course, I got to see
