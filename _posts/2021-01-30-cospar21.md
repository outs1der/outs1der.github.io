The <a href="https://cospar2021.org">43<sup>rd</sup> COSPAR Scientific
Assembly</a> was to be held in Sydney last August, but thanks to the 
COVID-19 pandemic, it was delayed until this week. Sudip Bhattacharya and
I led a session on "Rapidly Rotating Neutron Stars", which featured a terrific
set of presentations on radio and X-ray pulsars, as well as gravitational
waves.
</p>
<p>Monash PhD student Ka Ho Tse presented some of his 
<a href="/~dgallow/cgi-bin/blosxom.cgi/postgrads/mhz_qpos.html">recent work</a>
on the enigmatic mHz quasi-periodic oscillations observed in some burst
sources, suggestive of quasi-stable nuclear burning but at accretion rates an 
order of magnitude below where we would expect them.
</p>
<p>The COSPAR organisers imposed a very complex virtual program, with speakers
required to pre-record full duration talks as well as 3-minute summaries. 
The platform was overly complicated, and plagued with technical issues; 
on top of that, having to go on your own time to view the full-duration talks
kind of defeats the purpose of the session.
</p>
<p>I'm not sure how well it worked for attendees, but for session organisers
it was a nightmare, and I was glad when it was over. Some organisers of 
other sessions abandoned the platform altogether and switched to Zoom.
These large virtual conferences are very challenging to set up, and it's all
well and good to be ambitious with the format, but it would have been much
better to keep it simple.
It was also a bit galling for the organisers to 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=131&v=6vYBsfOsfy4&feature=youtu.be">blame the chairs and speakers</a> in the closing address.
