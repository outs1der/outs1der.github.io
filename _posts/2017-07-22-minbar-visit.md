This (northern) summer I visited colleagues at 
<a href="http://www.space.dtu.dk/english">DTU Space, Denmark</a> and 
<a href="https://www.sron.nl">SRON, Netherlands</a> to continue work on the
<a href="http://burst.sci.monash.edu/minbar">Multi-INstrument Burst ARchive
(MINBAR)</a>.
We're currently preparing for the first data release (DR1), and we made a lot
of progress with the data analysis and assembly of the companion paper.
We also got to celebrate the deployment of 
<a href="https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/nicer"><em>NICER</em></a> to the
International Space Station, although because of a delay our celebration was a
little early!</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the careful eye of 
<a href="https://personal.sron.nl/~jeanz">Jean in 't Zand</a> identified a
handful of bursts observed by 
<a href="https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/xte/xte_1st.html"><em>RXTE</em></a>
from a 2008-9 transient, XTE J1812-182, that was not previously
known to be a burster. We reported our discovery in 
<a href="http://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=10567">Astronomer's Telegram
#10567</a> and will shortly present a more detailed analysis via a paper.
While this is a very pleasing outcome from the meeting, it now means there are
even <b>more</b> bursts to analyse for MINBAR!
