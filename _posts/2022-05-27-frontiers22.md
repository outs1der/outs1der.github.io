Thanks to COVID it's been a few years since I attended one of the
excellent Frontiers meetings, presented by the <a
href="https://www.jinaweb.org">Joint Institute for Nuclear Astrophysics
&mdash; Center for the Evolution of the Elements (JINA-CEE)</a>. This
year's <a href="https://indico.frib.msu.edu/event/28">meeting</a> (the 10th
in the series!) saw a return to South Bend, IN. As usual the meeting covered
a wide range of nuclear astrophysics topics as well as including the excellent
attendee-driven "unconference" sessions. I gave a talk on our ongoing (and
seemingly never-ending) work on comparing thermonuclear burst models with
observations, and we also had a great discussion session led by <a
href="https://www.ohio.edu/cas/meisel">Zach Meisel</a> with a few new
contributors. With JINA-CEE funding coming to a close this year, there is
some uncertainty about what the future holds for this conference series,
but plenty of enthusiasm for seeing it continue.
