While examining <em>RXTE</em> data for the
<a href="http://burst.sci.monash.edu/minbar">MINBAR</a> project two summers ago,
<a href="https://www.sron.nl/~jeanz/">Jean in 't Zand</a> unexpectedly 
<a href="http://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=10567">discovered</a>
a brand-new bursting source, XMMU&nbsp;J181227.8&mdash;181234.
Now 
PhD student <a href="https://twitter.com/astro_del">Adelle Goodwin</a>'s 
paper on the source has been accepted by MNRAS.
The source is quite unusual; distant and hence low-intensity, but apparently
a high accretion rate leading to frequent (but weak) bursts. The shape of
the bursts strongly implies H-poor accreted composition, but we also found
evidence for short recurrence-time bursts, which previously have been seen 
only in H-rich accretors. 
Hopefully the source will go into outburst again sometime soon and we can
gather more information on it's properties.
