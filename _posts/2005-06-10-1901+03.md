      <img src="images/1901.gif" align="left">Back in 2003 we made <em>RXTE</em> observations of a new outburst of an old transient last seen in the early '70s, 4U&nbsp;1901+03. We <a href="http://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=118">found pulsations</a> at 2.763&nbsp;s and an almost-circular orbit with period 22.58&nbsp;d. Like <a href="http://users.monash.edu.au/~dgallow/2004/07/frequency-glitch-in-accreting-pulsar.html">KS&nbsp;1947+30</a>, this likely Be-X-ray binary has a much smaller than expected eccentricity of 0.036, suggesting that the natal kick from the supernova explosion which formed the neutron star was unusually small.<br clear="left">
