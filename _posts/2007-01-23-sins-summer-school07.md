      Last week I spent two days at the first <a href="http://www.maths.monash.edu.au/~johnl/sins/school">Stellar Interiors and Nucleosynthesis summer school</a>, hosted by the <a href="http://www.cspa.monash.edu.au/">CSPA</a> at Monash U. I gave a talk on nuclear processes in thermonuclear bursts, which was good since it forced me to actually learn a little bit more about this subject. Most of the other talks were pretty hard-core stellar physics, but Jordi Jose gave a nice series of talks on classical novae and type 1a supernovae.
