      <img src="/images/2pulsar.jpg" width="91" height="83" align="left">I'm not sorry to be wrong about <a href="2007/06/hete-j19001-2455-is-returning-to.html">HETE&nbsp;J1900.1-2455 returning to quiescence</a>; <em>Swift</em> and <em>RXTE</em> observations following the nondetection last month indicate that the <a href="http://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=1106">source is as bright as before</a>. This is bad news for anticipated measurements of the quiescent flux with <em>Chandra</em>, but good news for our ongoing <em>RXTE</em> monitoring and pulsation searches. <p>
Also last month the 8th accretion-powered millisecond pulsar was discovered, <a href="http://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=1108">Swift&nbsp;J1756.9-2508</a>. At 182&nbsp;Hz the source is the slowest of the class (by 3&nbsp;Hz); the <a href="http://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=1114">54-minute orbital period</a> indicates an ultracompact (and thus likely H-poor) mass donor. The pulsar was only active for two weeks, and was <a href="http://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=1117">undetected</a> with <em>Swift</em> by June 21. A paper is in preparation by the <em>Swift</em> team.
