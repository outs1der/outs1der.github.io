Late last year I took over from 
<a href="https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/persons/matt-owers">Matt
Owers</a> as the "science lead" for the 
<a href="https://astronomyaustralia.org.au">AAL</a>/<a href="https://www.mpe.mpg.de/450415/eROSITA">eROSITA</a>
collaboration, which manages the MOU between these two organisations with
the goal of maximising opportunities for multi-wavelength astronomy
projects across the southern sky. My first major task was to help with the
organisation of the <a
href="https://astronomyaustralia.org.au/event/2022-australia-erosita_de-joint-collaboration-workshop">annual
workshop</a>, which was held virtually between 21&mdash;23 February
</p>
<p>This workshop was a great opportunity to hear about the progress of the
survey efforts by the team in Germany, as well as the various ongoing
collaboration projects. There is plenty of synergy between the various
radio and optical survey activities here in Australia, and we had some
great talks on the resulting science.</p>
<p>As an X-ray astronomer who's worked for a long time to encourage more
Australian activity in this area, it's really heartening to see this
cooperation &mdash; even if up to now I've had little to do with it! If
you missed the meeting many of the talks will be posted online shortly.
