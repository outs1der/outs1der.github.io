This week I enjoyed attending (virtually) a 
<a href="https://indico.frib.msu.edu/event/51">workshop on neutron-star
cooling</a> 
at the
<a href="https://www.washington.edu/research/research-centers/institute-for-nuclear-theory-int">UW Institute for Nuclear Theory</a>.
Neutron stars are "hot" immediately after formation but generally cool
fairly rapidly, unless they are subsequently heated by other processes.
One option is accretion, where a binary companion can donate material to
the neutron star, heating it (as well as causing lots of other interesting
phenomena like pulsations and thermonuclear bursts). </p>
<p>When accretion turns off we can measure how the neutron star cools,
which provides information about the conditions in the crust; observations
of some sources has been going on for more than a decade. This
workshop was dedicated to a broad theoretical and observational view of
this phenomenon, and I gave an invited talk on 
<a href="docs/Galloway Thermonuclear Bursts INT 2022.pdf">observations of
thermonuclear bursts and superbursts</a>.</p>
<p>It was really nice to be attending a conference again, even if
virtually, and if the time zone wasn't exactly conducive to full
particpation from my part! Thanks to the organisers and sponsors for
putting together an great program.</p>
