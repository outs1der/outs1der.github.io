<p>It's been a few years now since a review of thermonuclear bursts came out,
so a little while ago <a href="http://www.tomasobelloni.it">Tomaso Belloni</a>
and 
<a href="https://www.astro.rug.nl/~mariano">Mariano Mendez</a> commissioned
<a href="http://xrb.space">Laurens Keek</a>
and I to write one. It's a big job to try to cover the literature in such a
broad field, and this took (unfortunately) a lot longer than we expected.
Tomaso and Mariano were very patient, and I'm pleased to announce that the 
review is finally ready! You can read it for yourself on the arXiv, or wait
for it as part of "Timing Neutron Stars: Pulsations, Oscillations and
Explosions", in 
<a href="http://www.springer.com/series/5664">Springer's ASSL series</a>, edited by  Tomaso and Mariano
