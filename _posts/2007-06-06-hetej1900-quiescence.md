      The most recently-discovered millisecond pulsar, HETE&nbsp;J1900.1-2455, has finally begun to fade into quiescence. The last couple of observations in May saw the flux below 10<sup>-10</sup>&nbsp;erg&nbsp;cm<sup>-2</sup>&nbsp;s<sup>-1</sup>, and fading, as reported in <a href="http://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=1086">ATel #1086</a>. Collaborators in the Netherlands, led by Rudy Wijnands, triggered a series of <a href="http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/swift/swiftsc.html"><em>Swift</em></a> observations, which <a href="http://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=1091">confirmed the decline</a>. <em>Swift</em> observations are ongoing, and a <em>Chandra</em> pointing is planned for the end of June. HETE&nbsp;J1900.1-2455 was active for almost 2 years &mdash; longer by far than any of the other accretion-powered millisecond pulsars. We're sorry to see it go!
