Had a great week at the 
<a href="https://www.int.washington.edu">Institute for Nuclear Theory</a>
in Seattle, WA while attending the 
<a href="https://www.int.washington.edu/programs-and-workshops/irena-24">IReNA-INT Joint Workshop on Thermal and Magnetic Evolution of Neutron Stars</a>.
This workshop brought together theoretical and observational
astrophysicists, with nuclear experimenters and theorists, and covered a
wide range of topics of relevance to understanding neutron stars. I kicked
things off on Monday talking about some of the exciting new observations
of thermonuclear bursts that have happened over the last couple of years.

<p>I really like the INT's approach to bring researchers together in small,
focussed workshops to help encourage progress. A relaxed schedule &mdash;
with afternoons free for general discussion and pop-up talks &mdash; is
ideal. And even though the in-person interactions are most valuable, the
organisers encouraged on-line presentations and participation, which is
mandatory IMO for modern meetings. (I'd presented twice before to INT
workshops, but both times remotely). I really appreciate the support of 
<a href="https://www.irenaweb.org">IReNA</a> which made my attendance
possible.</p>
