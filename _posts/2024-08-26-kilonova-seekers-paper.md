<a href="http://goto-observatory.org">GOTO</a> team members 
<a href="https://tkilleste.in">Tom Killestein</a> and 
<a href="https://www.kicc.cam.ac.uk/staff/dr-lisa-kelsey">Lisa Kelsey</a>
have done an incredible job developing and managing our "flagship" outreach
program, 
<a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/tkillestein/kilonova-seekers">Kilonova Seekers</a>, 
<a href="/outreach/2023/07/12/kilonova-seekers.html">launched</a> with
great fanfare back in 2023.
The project provides candidate transients detected by GOTO and asks users
to play "spot the difference" in distingushing genuine transients (or
source variability) from various kinds of artifacts that crop up in our
differencing procedure.
Tom & Lisa wrote up their work for MNRAS and the 
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stae1817">paper</a> has now been
published. Accompanying the paper were press releases from 
<a href="https://www.port.ac.uk/news-events-and-blogs/news/citizen-science-project-identifies-20-new-astronomical-discoveries">Portsmouth</a>,
<a href="https://www.utu.fi/en/news/press-release/citizen-science-project-identifies-20-new-astronomical-discoveries">Turku</a>, 
<a href="https://le.ac.uk/news/2024/august/kilonova-seekers">Leicester</a>
and even 
<a href="https://www.monash.edu/science/news-events/news/current/citizen-science-project-identifies-20-new-astronomical-discoveries">Monash</a>,
the latter also acknowledging the contribution of Monash PhD student
Sergey Belkin. Although it was not possible to include all our
contributing volunteer scientists
in the author list, they are acknowledged in the paper's appendix A; all
4.5 pages of them! Keep up the great work
