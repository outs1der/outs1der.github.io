Melbourne</a>. This annual event brings astronomers from all over the country (and the world) together for a week to catch up, present their research, and also award prizes to researchers and students. I gave a <a href="http://users.monash.edu.au/~dgallow/docs/ASA 2009 poster.pdf">poster</a> describing work on using mixed H/He thermonuclear bursts to deduce the neutron star redshift. Zdenka gave a talk on preliminary results from her comparisons of burst properties and models in the candidate He accretor 4U&nbsp;1728-34. It was nice to be back on campus at U.Melbourne for a week &mdash; great location and even better coffee!
