      <img src="/docs/ASA 2009 poster.pdf">poster</a> describing work on using mixed H/He thermonuclear bursts to deduce the neutron star redshift. Zdenka gave a talk on preliminary results from her comparisons of burst properties and models in the candidate He accretor 4U&nbsp;1728-34. It was nice to be back on campus at U.Melbourne for a week &mdash; great location and even better coffee!
