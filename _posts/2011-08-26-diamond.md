Science 
<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/early/2011/08/19/science.1208890.abstract">reported this month</a> on a planet discovered orbiting around a 
rotation-powered millisecond pulsar. The discovery was made by astronomers 
from Swinburne University, CSIRO, and several other institutions worldwide,
using the <a href="http://www.parkes.atnf.csiro.au">Parkes Radio Telescope</a>.
Remarkably, the planet &ndash; likely the remnant of some flavour of white
dwarf, possibly composed of carbon and oxygen &ndash; has a density so high,
that it must be crystalline. Hence, a gigantic diamond. <br><em>This was my
first piece for <a href="http://theconversation.edu.au">The Conversation</a>,
a fantastic new independent site featuring news and commentary sourced from
the university and research sector. Check it out!</em>
