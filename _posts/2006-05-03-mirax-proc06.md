      Here's the paper <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0604345">"Accretion-powered Millisecond Pulsar Outbursts"</a> I submitted to the proceedings  of the <a href="http://www.das.inpe.br/workshop_mirax">MIRAX workshop</a> last December. The paper describes the properties and inferred long-term accretion 
rates for the seven accretion-powered millisecond pulsars (AMSPs) discovered to date.
Unusually, 
the most recently-discovered
source HETE J1900.1-2455, has been active for more than 8 months; 
the long-term averaged accretion rate may thus be the largest of all the
AMSPs.
We also estimated
an upper limit of 6 kpc to the distance of IGR J00291+5934 based on the
non-detection of bursts from this source.
