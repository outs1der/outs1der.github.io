This month we were lucky enough to have a sizeable group of thermonuclear
burst experts in town, both visitors and attendees to the August
<a href="http://nic2012.org">Nuclei in the Cosmos</a> meeting. We
arranged a workshop-of-opportunity at Monash on July 27<sup>th</sup>, with
a day of talks and discussions on a wide range of topics of interest for
thermonuclear burst aficionados. The workshop dinner at the palatial 
<a href="http://www.thenott.com.au">Notting Hill Hotel</a> rounded out a
very enjoyable day. I gave a talk on the status of burst observations, while
MoCA students Nathanael Lampe and Hauke Worpel also presented their work.
