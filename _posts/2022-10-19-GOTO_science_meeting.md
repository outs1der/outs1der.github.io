What with one thing or another, it's been a while since we assembled (virtually or 
IRL) our <a href="http://goto-observatory.org">GOTO</a> collaboration team to
discuss science. So this October we assembled the team for a 3-day meeting covering
the project status, progress and plans.
</p>
<p>It's a really exciting time for our collaboration at the moment, with ongoing
technical work at La Palma, the commencement of platform construction at Siding
Spring, and the <a href="https://observing.docs.ligo.org/plan">imminent start of the
4th observing run</a> for the LIGO/Virgo network. At the same time there are plenty
of technical issues to overcome, delays from 
<a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-09-16/flood-rescues-and-calls-for-help-nsw-central-west-after-rain/101446496">apocalyptic weather</a>
to work through, and the ongoing impact of a global pandemic.</p>
<p>Of course it would be preferable to get together in person but the online format
is more inclusive and more environmentally friendly, 
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-020-1169-1">minimising the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions</a> 
that would otherwise be incurred with an in-person meeting. Additionally it requires
much less overhead to organise, which is a help! Particular thanks to 
<a href="https://jimenez-ibarra.wixsite.com/felipeji">Felipe Jiminez-Ibarra</a> and 
<a href="https://au.linkedin.com/in/travis-mong-4709631b0">Travis Mong</a> for
their efforts in organising.
