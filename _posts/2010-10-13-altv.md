In one of the public 2008 observations of bursters by <em>RXTE</em> we noticed
a new event from a relatively quiet source, 2S&nbsp;0918-549. On closer
inspection, Jean in 't Zand noticed a remarkable interval of strong variability
late in this long (~300 s) event. This type of variability, which is
achromatic (i.e. energy-independent) and 
seems to be restricted to bursts with extremely strong radius-expansion, may
arise from disruption and later resettling of the accretion disk. Our paper
has been accepted by A&A and is also out at <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1009.5359">arXiv:1009.5359</a>.
