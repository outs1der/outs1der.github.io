<a href="http://goto-observatory.org">GOTO</a> collaboration Tom
Killestein and Lisa Kelsey oversaw the launch at the 
<a href="https://nam2023.org">UK NAM</a> this week of a wonderful new
citizen-science initative, 
<a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/tkillestein/kilonova-seekers">Kilonova Seekers</a>.
The project provides candidate transients from GOTO and asks users to play
"spot the difference" in distingushing genuine transients (or source
variability) from various kinds of artifacts that crop up in our
differencing procedure. Tom & Lisa had previously set up a platform for
use within the collaboration to help vet our templates used for
subtraction, but this new effort draws in a much wider pool of potential
helpers to contribute directly to the highest-priority science,
identifying kilonovae in our transient stream. By the end of the week we'd
already had more than 100k classifications by 650 volunteers, an
incredible success! The launch was followed by a

from Monash's press office and Lisa was also

The input from this program will soon be directly integrated into our
internal tools for identifying high-priority transients for followup.</p>
