Just got back from a wonderful visit to the 
<a href="http://issibern.ch">International Space Science Insitute</a> in
Bern. A really productive 3 weeks, working with colleagues 
<a href="https://www.issibern.ch/people/prof-dr-maurizio-falanga">Maurizio
Falanga</a> (also ISSI Director) and Zhaosheng Li, also visiting from 
<a href="https://en.xtu.edu.cn/info/1028/1632.htm">Xiangtan U.</a>. Some
good discussions about thermonuclear bursts and work with data from
China's
<em><a href="http://hxmten.ihep.ac.cn">HXMT-Insight</a></em> telescope.
</p><p>
Also spent plenty of time working on the
<a href="https://github.com/adellej/beans">beansp</a> code and made some
really significant improvements to the code, which hopefully should be
reported soon in a paper.
</p><p>
It wasn't all work though and I inadvertently timed my visit to include
ISSI's annual dinner at the lovely
<a href="https://www.bellevue-palace.ch/en">Bellevue Palace</a>, a
wonderful night. I also enjoyed two weekends of glorious (although cold)
weather, biking through the Aare and Rh&ocirc;ne valleys, and of
course all the glorious food. Particular thanks to my ISSI hosts for
making me feel at home!
