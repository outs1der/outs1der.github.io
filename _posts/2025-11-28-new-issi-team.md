The first meeting of our new 
<a href="https://teams.issibern.ch/thermonuclearx-raybursts/">international team on thermonuclear bursts</a> has just concluded.
Team members and local attendees met in Beijing at the
<a href="http://www.issibj.ac.cn">International Space Science Institute's Chinese networking venue</a>, at
<a href="http://english.nssc.cas.cn">NSSC</a>.
Attendees from the Netherlands, USA, Spain, Japan, China and of course Australia delivered
talks and participated in discussions ranging widely over topics relevant to thermonuclear bursts, and we also heard about exciting new observations
from new facilities like <a href="http://hxmten.ihep.ac.cn"><em>Insight-HXMT</em></a> and 
<a href="https://ep.bao.ac.cn/ep/"><em>Einstein Probe</em></a>.
</p>
<p>As is tradition we broke up the scientific sessions with excursions to local sights including the Forbidden City and a nearby
stretch of the Great Wall. We enjoyed wonderful late autumn weather and the generous hospitality of 
team leader Zhaosheng Li and students from
<a href="https://en.xtu.edu.cn/info/1028/1632.htm">Xiangtan U.</a>.
