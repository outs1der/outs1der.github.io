<a href="http://asa.astronomy.org.au/asa.html">Astronomical Society of
Australia</a> held its
<a href="http://asa2013.monash.edu">Annual Scientific Meeting</a> at 
<a href="http://monash.edu">Monash</a>'s own Clayton campus last month.
The ASM has not been held at Monash since 1991, so it has been  a long time
coming. The 
<a href="http://asa2013.monash.edu/hwws">Harley Wood Winter school</a> was
held, as is traditional, immediately prior to the ASM on Phillip Island. 
The winter school was a great success, attracting 76 attendees; kudos to the
organisational team led by 
<a href="http://monash.edu/science/about/schools/physics/people/students/kleiner.html">Dane Kleiner</a> (SOC chair) and 
<a href="http://monash.edu/science/about/schools/physics/people/students/crossett.html">Jake Crossett</a> (LOC chair).

The meeting itself kicked off on Sunday evening with a very civilised opening
reception, and continued throughout the week. Highlights for me included the
great opening speech by Monash Chancellor
<a href="http://www.adm.monash.edu/execserv/council/profile.html">Dr. Alan Finkel</a>; the special session on science with the Mileura Widefield Array (MWA)
and the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP); and the 
conference dinner in Chinatown featuring the very smooth 
Leon de Bruin quintet.

<p>
The local organising committee was chaired by yours truly, and the rest of the
meeting ran very smoothly with the help
of the rest of the LOC; the excellent SOC (chaired by 
<a href="http://monash.edu/science/about/schools/physics/people/academic/brown.html">Michael Brown</a>);
and the expert conference organisation team of Danielle, Bree & Kristie from
<a href="http://asnevents.com.au">ASN Events</a>.
Many thanks to everyone who helped make it
a success, including of course the speakers, poster presenters, tweeters, and
all the other attendees!
