Another possible site
for the southern counterpart of our <a href="http://goto-observatory.org">GOTO</a> instrument on La Palma is USQ's <a href="https://www.usq.edu.au/hes/school-of-agricultural-computation-and-environmental-sciences/mt-kent-observatory">Mt. Kent observatory</a>.
About 30 min drive from Toowoomba, Mt. Kent is significantly easier to get to compared to 
<a href="/~dgallow/cgi-bin/blosxom.cgi/gravitational%20waves/goto-south.html">Siding Spring</a>, via the recently-upgraded <a href="https://www.wellcamp.com.au">Wellcamp</a> airport, and offers comparable observing conditions.
Even better, they already have some spare concrete pads that might suit a GOTO-sized instrument!
Earlier in the year we submitted a 
funding proposal to support development of the
telescope from 2019 onwards. Fingers crossed!
