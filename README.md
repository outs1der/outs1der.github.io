This is my work webpage, which is set up to run in [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), adapted from the earlier site at http://users.monash.edu/~dgallow (which now redirects here), which ran instead on [blosxom](http://blosxom.sourceforge.net)

The features are not quite all there yet, but it's not too far off; still to implement:
* "archive" features like year, category pages
* individual post pages
